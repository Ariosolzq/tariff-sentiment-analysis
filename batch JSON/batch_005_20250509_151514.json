A lot of times, you would pull pieces of equipment from one order and give it to a higher paying customer and tell the original customer \"sorry supply chain delays/difficult to source\". There isn't an industry in the US where the companies that comprised it weren't price gouging each other during and after covid lockdowns. In the end, the consumer and the government footed the bill. There literally was no inflation it was just price gouging at every level the whole time, that is why they tried to bring the bill to congress to combat price gouging.",

The reality, of course, is that if a widget normally sells for $100, with tariffs it might be $110.  To remain competitive the manufacturer might lower their price to $95.45 so that the final price consumers see, after tariffs, is $105.  The manufacturer did lower their price, but the consumer still has to pay more than without the tariff.\n\nThe funny thing to me is that this guy from OP's screenshot has been posted before, he was complaining about $77 on a ~$5000 purchase.  This is just the early raw material tariffs, when he (or others like him) starts seeing tariff charges of $1-2k on the same purchase, the reaction is going to be hilarious.",

        "body": "I explained it like this to someone like 3 or 4 days ago.\n\n\"Suppose you own a business. You sell pens. Without getting into specifics, it costs you 50 cents to make 10 pens, which you sell for 5 dollars a pack. Of the 5 dollars, employees cost you 1.50 to make the pens, the building costs you 1 dollar in upkeep. And to get the pens to the people who sell them, it costs you a nickle. So on every pack, you make $2.45. Not bad right?\"\n\nThey nodded.\n\n\"So now let's say that one day, the delivery service you use, raised prices. The cost of gasoline due to Brandon's stupid not drilling policy now costs you 2 dollars to ship the package of pens instead of 5 cents.\"\n\nThey nodded again, a bit more  at the mention of Brandon.\n\n\"So if you had to deal with this, what would you do.\"\n\n\"God damned Brandon. I dunno, probably raise the prices on my pens. And if the prices came down I'd lower it.\"\n\n\"Right, you'd raise prices. So now instead of you selling pens for 5, you have to sell them for 7 right? Just to keep your money per pack the same\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\nNow let's say that you wanna sell your package of pens to a dude overseas. Let's say someone in Germany. Normally he's gotta pay your $5 for your pens. But Germany decided that due to screwing the US that those pens cost more. The German dude still wants your pens but the officials like Merkel are charging you 2 dollars to get him those pens. What would you do?\"\n\n\"I guess I'd raise prices.\"\n\n\"Alright. So you'd raise prices. So for the guy who wanted to buy those pens, it's be $7, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Or 9 if you had to pay extra for Brandon's dumb gas rule, right?\"\n\n\"Yep\"\n\n\"Well, in this scenario, you're the guy in Germany. You wants to buy those pens from me, but because Germany is making me pay more to send your product to you, you've gotta pay me to make it financially viable to get you those pens.\"\n\n\"Ok, but why do I have to pay more\"\n\n\"I'm not paying extra to get you those pens. You want them, you've gotta pay them. Now if I wanna get around it, I could always build a pen making factory near you in germany. But why would I do that when a new factory might cost me a billion dollars to make and upkeep and I'd have to sell 100 billion packs just to make up the difference? It might be cheaper just to let you pay the extra $2 in the hopes that eventually the tariffs go away.\"\n\nBlank stare\n\n\"Like you said, if you didn't have to pay extra to make it, you wouldn't make me pay for the extra to get it. It's only because the gov't stepped in and said \\*I'd like 2 dollars please\\*, that makes me pay the extra 2 dollars.\"\n\n\"So why is it called a tax\"\n\n\"Dunno.\"\n\n\"Why didn't anyone warn me about this before\"\n\nThe urge to look off in the distance and look into a camera was so strong.",

Shackling people’s hands and feet and throwing random immigrants with no criminal conviction into El Salvador’s gang torture death prison is a good way to ensure your farm labor force doesn’t show their faces in public.\n\nThe imports are an issue, but domestic production isn’t looking good either. It’s the season for putting that future food in the ground and the cost of doing so this year is going to be substantially different than normal. The effects of this will take awhile to show up (things have to be grown, fertilized, taken care of, harvested, transported, processed, transported, shelved), but I can tell you right now that there isn’t a single part of that entire chain that isn’t going to feel it from the bottom up.\n\nAnd that doesn’t just affect America. America is the world’s largest food exporter. Yes, we import massive amounts too (a slight surplus recently - and we can’t grow a mango very well in Texas) but the foods we -export- (like corn) are core staple foods that important for the nutrition of billions of people globally. In terms of raw calories, we export significantly more calories than we import. We help feed the planet… or we used to.\n\nPeople will die because of this. USAID’s overnight shuttering alone is already starting to kill people in the most destitute parts of the world. The double whammy of increased costs on the food that does show up is going to hurt. Death toll will be in the millions when we’re done and looking back (the death toll just from USAID going away will be that high, let alone any of this other nonsense).\n\nAnd that’s if things don’t get worse…",

Sometimes it short circuits them. For example, at Thanksgiving last year my mom was complaining that during the Hurricanes in Florida people were \"forced\" to apply for aid from FEMA. No one was just going around helping. In the same moment my dad chimed in \"FEMA was deliberately skipping houses with Trump flags.\" To which I simply asked \"how can both those things be true? If people had to apply for aid to get it, then the Trump flag owners should have brought up their applications being denied. But that's not what you said. You said their houses were being ignored, as though FEMA was rolling through knocking on doors asking if people needed help, and skipping houses with Trump flags. But you just said they weren't going door to door looking for people in need. Also, you didn't know you had to apply for aid. So maybe it's possible that people with Trump flags also didn't know they had to apply for aid, so they didn't. Wouldn't it make more sense that they got overlooked because they never applied for aid, so the FEMA employees didn't know they needed it? The simplest answer is usually the most correct. Rather than get all mad about some big conspiracy, maybe we look at the actual facts at hand.\" Made them shut the hell up at least. Not sure if it got through to them though.",

That where I'm putting all the newer stuff together.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/s/Jw5W0MJp2P\n\n---\n\n\nAlright you beautiful degenerates, listen the fuck up. This isn’t just another $GME circlejerk or YOLO on $SPY puts. We are standing on the edge of a historic, systemic financial collapse—and the match has already been lit.\n\nTL;DR: The Fed blinked. Treasuries are teetering. China holds the detonator. You have days—maybe weeks—before the floor vanishes.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/markets/us/minn-feds-kashkari-rising-treasury-yields-could-show-investors-moving-us-2025-04-11/\n\nLet’s lay it out:\n\nTrump jacked tariffs on China to kingdom come. China hit back at 125%. But here’s the trick: they STOPPED there. No more escalation. That wasn’t weakness. That was positioning. \n\nJapan, China, and South Korea—yeah, the countries that usually hate each other—started chatting like old war buddies. Why? Because Trump’s trade policy has turned the U.S. into a geopolitical liability. They’re not teaming up for fun—they’re hedging against the collapse of American sanity.\n\nThen Japan started dumping U.S. Treasuries. Quietly. Just enough to send yields vertical and make Wall Street sweat bullets. That wasn’t random—it was a signal.\n\nSouth Korea? Still pumping chips. TSMC might start whispering to the Taiwanese government that maybe, just maybe, aligning with China isn’t such a bad idea if it means Trump stops threatening their supply chain. Yeah—soft reunification pressure, served cold.\n\nChina’s sitting on $759B in U.S. bonds. They start selling slowly. Not fast enough to crash the market—but enough to make everyone else wonder who’s selling. Then the dominoes fall. BRICS nations? Gone. Gulf states? Gone. Eurozone? GONE.\n\nAnd what do we get today? The Fed blinks.\n“We’ll stabilize the market if needed.”\nTranslation: “Please don’t run. But we’re scared shtless and ready to turn the money printers back on.”\n\nThat’s it. That’s the whole ballgame.\nThey just confirmed the Treasury market can’t stand without life support.\n\nYou are going to see:\n\nYields go to the fucking moon\n\nDollar starts shivering\n\nForeign investors pulling out\n\nBond auctions flopping like a meme ICO\n\nCredit lines dying overnight\n\nIlliquid companies—boom, dead\n\nFed intervention—guaranteed\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, a global fucking run on the U.S. debt system\n\nThis isn’t a recession. This is the moment the U.S. stops being the center of global finance.\n\nGet your puts. Get your gold. Hell, get your memes. But know this:\n\nChina’s not starting a war. They’re ending one.\nAnd they’re doing it with the one thing we can’t print: trust.\n\nTick tock.\n\nI hope to fuck I'm just an idiot.\n\nUpdate:\n\nhttps://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCBP/bulletins/3db9e55\n\nTrump just caved on some tariffs with China.\n\nUpdate#2\n\n6 hours in, and the mods still haven't given me a justification for removing my post. I take this as a compliment. \n\nUpdate#3\n\nMods restored post, apparently automod triggered on \"looking like ChatGPT\" 12ish hours after it was posted. \n\nThank you for restoring it.\n\nUpdate#4\n\nFuckit ban bet. \n\nIf we don't see a global move on US treasuries in the next month, ban me.\n",

I found major chinese hedge fund managers and economists streaming on douyin (their tiktok) and bilibili (their youtube) that normally only upload completed (edited) shorts and vids.\n\nThey were smirking and said 'even on its way out, the Americans are teaching us about stuff we have never seen before' and when one of the chatters raised the question about the 800 billion or so US bond holding that China had and what would happen if the US economy blew up? This is what he said:\n\n\"How much do you think China would be willing to pay for the US just to go away? How would you 'price' the cost of being able to do business without sanctions and bullying from the US? How fast do you think we can earn that back in a world free of empire, trading with Europe, South America and the rest of Asia? The CPC was ready to pay for liberation of the world if it meant war, an 800 billion bill to get rid of an empire, self imploded empire no less, is a deal they would take immediately. They are not worried about their holdings.\"\n\nNot sure about the rest of the countries that may or may not have a grudge against USA, but that scared me a little.\n\nEDIT:\n\nOkay I didn't expect this comment to blow up, but here is a few things that needs to be clarified for those of you who read the comment and started thinking like an American:\n\n* These guys are not 'grand standing' to scare the Americans in some sort of imaginary PR war, because:\n   * this was streaming on the day as it was happening, it was not a scheduled program,\n   * you need to use bilibili or have the Chinese version of tiktok that they use in China, \n   * you need to be searching for live broadcasts about economics on a platform that is 75% cats, food, and/or girls dancing;\n   * it was like 2 or 3 AM in the morning;\n   * there was no script or editing, it was just a bunch of 30-50 year olds talking and watching a number go up (the yield rate);\n   * the whole thing was broadcasted in MANDARIN CHINESE, and last time I checked Americans spoke AMERICAN.\n\nEdit 2: \n\nFor those who wants more details, I have a follow up comment to this comment with more information on what the chinese guys talked about.",

        "body": "Reposting this ELI5 I posted elsewhere earlier today.  Hope you find it helpful. \n\nImagine the U.S. government borrows money from people for 10 years and promises to pay them back with a bit of extra money (interest). That “bit of extra” is called the yield. A Treasury is basically that. It’s an instrument where the government borrows money and agrees to pay back more after a period of time. So the 10-year Treasury is a loan the government will pay back in 10 years with a little extra.\n\nNow let’s say I buy a Treasury for $10 and get $11 back from the government over 10 years. That’s a 10% return over its life, or about 0.96% annually if compounded, but roughly 1%/year if simplified. We call that a 1% yield.\n\nWhy does dumping bonds make the price go down? Simple supply and demand — just like selling stocks makes their prices go down. If you suddenly sell a lot of anything, the price drops because supply overwhelms demand. Now, China has almost $800 billion in Treasuries (and they are also a big buyer, which creates demand). Japan holds even more — about $1 trillion. That can move markets.\n\nAnd remember, even if China holds only a small fraction of total outstanding Treasuries, what matters is the float — that is, how much is being bought and sold at a given time. For example, say typically 1% of the houses in your city are on sale at any time. Now some real estate mogul decides to sell all his houses, which make up 2% of the housing stock. That’s a small fraction of all the homes in the city — but it triples the supply that’s for sale. There aren’t enough buyers for that. So prices drop. A lot.\n\nEven though it’s just a 2% change in total inventory, it’s a huge disruption to the normal market activity. Japan and China can flush the Treasury market in a similar way. If they sell a lot at once, there simply won’t be enough buyers ready with cash — and that’s what we call a liquidity crunch or low-liquidity situation.  Since China is a big Treasury buyer, they can affect the demand side too by stopping their buying.\n\nRemember that bond that paid $11 that I bought for $10??  Now let’s say I sell that bond for $8 because someone is dumping bonds and prices are falling. That bond still pays $11 over its life. So the person who buys it from me is getting a $3 gain on an $8 investment — or a 37.5% total return over 10 years. That translates into about 3.2% annually (compounded) — a big jump from the original 1% yield!\n\nSo as you can see, as bond prices go down, yields go up — they move inversely. Now, the next time the government wants to borrow money, it can’t offer the old 1% yield anymore. Why? Because people can just go buy that 3.2% yielding bond on the open market. To compete, the government has to raise the interest rate on new bonds to match what the market is demanding. So it ends up paying more to borrow money.\n\nWhy Is This Important?\n\nBecause the 10-year Treasury yield is a benchmark — many other loans (like mortgages, car loans, student loans, and business loans) key off of it.\n\nSo when the yield goes up, it means the U.S. government has to pay more to borrow — and so do you.\n\nHigher yields = higher interest rates across the board.\n\nThat’s bad for:\n\n• Homebuyers – higher mortgage rates = higher monthly payments\n\n• Businesses – higher borrowing costs = harder to invest, hire, or expand\n\n• The government – more of the federal budget goes toward interest payments instead of programs like schools or infrastructure\n\n• The stock market – investors shift money out of stocks and into safe, high-yielding bonds, pushing stock prices down\n\nBasically, because so many interest rates are tied to the 10-year Treasury yield, any increase in that yield raises the cost of capital for the entire economy. Getting money becomes more expensive. Business slows down. At the same time, stock prices drop.\n\nIt’s a double whammy.\n\nThat’s why people watch the health of the Treasury market so closely — because it affects nearly everything in the economy, even if you don’t own a single bond yourself.\n\nAnd China wouldn’t even need to crash the market — just sell slowly and steadily, nudging the long end of the yield curve upward over time. Exactly what we are seeing now.  That alone can quietly erode the U.S. economy. Think boiling frog.\n\nThe Chinese can then take the capital freed up from those Treasury sales and invest it back into their own domestic economy — infrastructure, industrial policy, innovation — effectively blunting the impact of a trade war. So they’re hitting the brakes on us while stepping on the gas at home.\n\nChina is smart enough to know this, and they have the tools to do it.\n\nThe dollar’s status as the global reserve currency gives the U.S. immense advantages. But there’s no such thing as a free lunch — and this kind of yield exposure is the price we pay for that privilege. As they say, “With great power comes great responsibility.”\n\nWhen the U.S. is strong, stable, and globally engaged, the financial pool is too deep for even China to make a splash. But if we start pulling back from the global economy, undermining our own institutions, and projecting unreliability? That’s when the macroeconomic knives can come out and actually hurt us.  A lot.\n\nThis is exactly why people like me are warning that Trump’s policies aren’t just misguided — they’re economically dangerous and fundamentally undermine American power.",

Trillions of dollars in national debt is in the balance, and resting on that scale that had been so carefully balanced was the detonator for a global depression that kills a billion people and utterly destroys the world order as had been built for a century by some of the most brilliant minds in human history: the western-led capitalist peace; guaranteed by the might of the US military and the cause of the greatest reduction in human suffering thus far recorded.\n\nDiseases were eradicated, entire nations lifted from poverty and into technological brilliance, a massive increase in the speed and scale of technological innovation, billions of humans given a real chance at a truly decent life with more rights than our ancestors could have ever imagined, and so much more.\n\nBut a few greedy fools have decided that they would rather burn all that down so they can rule over the pile of ashes. And a few million fools here voted for it. Of the eight billion inhabitants of the world, 77.3 million (0.97% of us) voted for the man who will destroy it all. He and his friends will be neither the instigators or the concluders of this disaster (the instigators walk among us today as fellow citizens), but their names will be the ones remembered for so long as economics are a human pursuit that is worthy of intellectual study.\n\nThe warnings were there the entire time, plainly found in black and white at the moment we wanted to see. Made available to us all at our immediate convenience. And yet those warnings were ignored time and time again in favor of foolish squabbles fed by lies and misguidance. Truth mangled into a mask that concealed a gnawing thirst of greed and self-interest that could never have been slaked.\n\n'Twas easier to ignore the warnings and blindly press on, it appears. To decide that the personal responsibility of utilizing political power is to accept the duty of remaining informed about their country and to question the claims of those who desire power was simply too much for them and casually dropped on the floor, of no more import than the empty foil wrapper for a piece of gum. Casually tossed aside and forgotten about.\n\nIt is these same people, these reckless slatterns, who have declared themselves the social arbiters of that which is or is not socially acceptable. Of what constitutes good citizenship.",

They’re unmatched in producing chips at cutting-edge levels, making Taiwan indispensable for modern tech.\n\nUSA: Excels in design (think Intel, NVIDIA, AMD) and EDA tools (software for chip design like Synopsys and Cadence). While the U.S. has fabs, it historically relies on Taiwan for advanced chip production. The CHIPS Act is trying to bring more fabrication back to the U.S.\n\n[Update 2005-Jan-28 The USA is only mentioned due to the sources I am referring from. This was only a summary but we all are interconnected and need one another. The USA portion isn't independent of knowing that the companies, although based on the USA, are formed by the world's talented people. My post has missed things like Dutch/Norwegian? and other contributions, machines, manufacturing, etc. We were only talking about the supply chain that affected the world that winds up in Taiwan that Trump's work is hurting the USA itself. This wasn't about ignoring the rest of the world.]\n\nBoth are crucial: Taiwan for making chips, the USA for designing and innovating them. However, it is a protection for Taiwan to survive and it doesn't give out due to the ability to keep its people safe. The USA may be meeting some supply chain needs more than directly manufacturing these advanced chips and tech.",

He wants to make money, and what better way to do that than with the threat of tariffs moving the entire market at his whim. \n\nWe're not talking about them all making a sure-bet 9% on the rise in the market today after the announcement. With creative investing instruments, one could make not only a multiple of that gain, but \\*many times\\* their original investment. Their are people in the Trump orbit who today turned millions into tens, or even hundreds, on millions.\n\nIt's actually pretty smart if you don't have a moral compass and seek the maximum financial advantage, consequences on everyone else be damned.\n\nWhat else really besides tariffs allows the president to move markets -- both upward and down -- at his will, without instituting any permanent policy? Just on his word, they've discovered now that they can basically send the \\*entire\\* market up or down about 10%. With insider information ahead of time, one could make almost unlimited proceeds betting before the rise or dip.\n\nUsing margin leverage and derivatives, they bet on outlier moves in the market, which normally would be very rare, but here they know they're almost certain to happen with such world-shaking announcements.\n\nThis, for them, is like walking up to the roulette wheel 98% certain which number it will hit. And like anyone would, they bet accordingly -- and most of them have a lot to start with.",

France's contribution was *literally* one of the deciding factors in the war and they took over a billion livres in debt. This was a *significant* contributing factor in the French Revolution because after losing to the British *and* lending so heavily to the (now independent) US, the country's finances were in ruin.\n\nAnd how did America thank the French? That's right. A decade after independence, Congress simply said \"fuck you\" and suspended paying the loan. So tensions rose and French privateers began raiding US ships.\n\nThese fuckers have always been tax dodgers and opportunists at every turn.",

    "selftext": "The election results had been bad enough on their own. It kept me awake at night the past few days but I was still able to console myself. I had a job, I had a good support system and good insurance. Surely I could drown out the impending misery of the 4 years to come by burying myself in work right? \n\n  \nWrong. I got pulled into a call this morning by HR with my boss. They did the whole schtick of \"we value for your time and effort and loyalty blah blah blah but with the Trump election and incoming tariffs and uncertainty in the economic future we have to downsize and thus we are ending your employment effective immediately blah blah blah\"\n\nThe worst part? I had been working closely with my boss for the past few months towards earning a promotion. I wanted to earn it and my boss and I had made a roadmap of tasks and  new duties so I could EARN a promotion by the end of the year. I was well on track and not just surviving but thriving! \n\n  \nEverything was going smoothly. Had Harris won the election, I sincerely doubt this would have happened. Maybe I am wrong, who knows. It would be super stupid to blame this on the Trump administration but hey, that was the HR person's words. Not mine. \n\n  \nI am not asking for pity, or money, lawyers, or even assistance in job hunting. Right now, I just needed this time to think and wanted a place to rant. I truly believe its time for me to leave corporate america for good and find something else that actually gives me purpose in the one life I have. ",

        "body": "Because Trump's tariff idea is one of the dumbest ideas you can imagine. And if he goes through with it, it'll be devastating. This is only the beginning.\n\nThe point of tariffs IS to raise prices. That is how they work. Using tariffs properly means picking a very specific industry, putting up a tariff and then potentially subsidizing the industry to some degree at home. This means the people in that industry at home can offer the product at a lower price, while those outside of the country can never keep up with that price because of the tariffs. And so you can grow a domestic industry, even if it would otherwise not be viable.\n\nTariffs are mostly a tool for developing countries, or something for key strategic industries, such as microchips.\n\nThey are also very risky because, for example, they can cause trade wars and retaliation and all other sorts of instability. And that's when they're used well.\n\nTariffs across the board make no sense. There just aren't enough people in the United States working at a low enough price to produce ALL of the things that Americans normally import. This means a drop in supply and higher prices. Potentially higher costs for American corporations too since the things they have to import to make their own products now cost more.\n\nTrump doesn't understand anything about the economy. He's a complete moron.\n\nBest everyone can hope for is that he doesn't actually end up doing it, or does a significantly lesser more targetted version of it. But as you, in this post, demonstrate the threat of it is damaging in itself.",

Fed refuses to reduce rates as inflation creeps back up\n3. White House says the Fed isn't protecting the economy\n4. White House says their data says the Fed is wrong\n5. Treasury secretary says the Fed is wrong\n6. Trump pushes for a no-confidendence on the Fed to remove independence\n7. Congress attempts to repeal dodd frank and amend the Fed Reserve act of 1913\n8. Trump moves the Fed into the executive branch purview \n\nWe all lose our shirts, and the billionaires who can weather the storm come out ahead.",

Rhetoric will probably include “anti-American boycotts” and call us marxists/leftists/liberals etc. \n\nHaving a large number of people actively trying to cause economic pain to large corporations makes us an easy out to excuse the most ridiculous trade policy we have ever seen.\n\nPrepare yourself for an especially mean Fox News segment and pure demonization. We’re going to be the next scapegoat. \n\n\n\nedit: this post is not meant to be pro-consumerism. It is to keep aware that boycotters/anti consumerists will be in the crosshairs - the cult needs someone to blame. Do not think in terms of reason and reality with MAGA: the important thing is the headline and talking points they can make in a conservative vacuum. \n\nSolidarity! ",

I can definitely tell you that people got pissed off when they were told they should get everything they voted for. I can tell you that they voted like it was some season of American Idol and not something that would affect their lives and the lives of others for decades. They sat there celebrating because \"their side\" won. That's all they get. That's all they care about. \n\nIn the Age of FAFO, they will still not understand the ramifications of what they've done. How can they? They literally can't understand what's going on around them, and their views are delivered by Fox News without any real counter. They are locked in, and when the hammer comes down, they will look to whoever their fearless leaders tell them to look to assign blame. IMHO failure is the goal. They're going to treat the country like a failing company. They are going to strip it for parts, get rid of any department that would get in the way, and carve away what forward progress was made to give people some level of equality. \n\nDepending on how hard they push the gas, the shock to the country will be substantial, and we'll all be too busy trying to survive to stop them from the next stage, which is channeling all of those governmental services through private companies and some of those companies will have crosses on them. No disrespect to the believers out there, but that shit will probably be the final nail because once religion becomes education, there will be no longer a need for critical thinking. Their Bible will be edited, and there will only be one, supplied by the state. And don't give me some shit about catholic schools and Sunday schools, no... this will be different, and it will be mandatory. \n\nBut maybe I'm being too doom and gloom about this. If enough people wake the fuck up, there's a chance to slow progress in the midterms...but, let's just say I'm dubious as to whether or not people will. I already put my faith in people, and they voted in this asshole for president. My faith in people isn't exactly the best at the moment. I will put my vote in... provided the darkest timeline shit in my head doesn't come to fruition. I'll do my part.",

I don’t understand how they can continue to see the results of their bad choices and still make them at the expense of everyone. Including themselves. \n\nTrump wants to increase the immunity for police officers. When I hear about black Americans voting for him, I just think of people like Breonna Taylor or the little boy with the toy gun, (was it Rice? I’m blanking because there are too damn many names). The officers that killed them will have MORE protection to do the same again. Isn’t he tired of that? Doesn’t he see what it does to the African American community? I don’t understand how he can feel so detatched from that and vote for someone who literally hates his guts because of his skin. It boggles the mind that any BIPOC, woman, immigrant from any country and LGBTQ person would cast a vote for him. He and his friends are targeting all of those groups in various ways. It’s quite literally like smashing a hammer into your own face and knocking all your teeth out. \n\nHe his still in FA phase, I hope he gains some sense before he REALLY reaches the FO phase.

People are good, a person is bad. But they are unfortunately bad in such an outsized way that it affects more people negatively.",

    "selftext": "\"People were getting a little queasy.\" Trump says he was watching bond market reaction to tariff measures\n\n President Donald Trump said he was watching volatility in the bond market in recent days and appeared to indicate that it was among the factors that led to his decision to institute a 90-day pause on some tariffs.\n\n“I was watching the bond market. The bond market is very tricky. I was watching it. But if you look at it now, it’s beautiful. The bond market right now is beautiful. But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy,” he said.\n\nCNN reported prior to the president’s decision that US Treasury yields had risen in recent days as investors sold off bonds. The benchmark 10-year yield Wednesday morning was 4.4% – up from 3.9% before Trump unveiled his tariffs.\n\nTrump also said he watched JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Fox Business Network this morning.\n\nThe CEO “made the statement to the effect that something had to be done with the tariffs and trade. … He understood it,” Trump said. “It wasn’t sustainable what was happening. Somebody had to pull the trigger. I was willing to pull the trigger.”\n\nDuring that appearance, Dimon warned that a recession was a “likely outcome” of the escalating trade war resulting from Trump’s tariff policies.\n\n“No one’s wishing for (a recession) but hopefully if there is one it’ll be short,” he said. “I do think fixing these tariff issues and trade issues would be a good thing to do.” \n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-tariffs-cnn-town-hall-04-09-25/index.html",

But in this case I wonder if it was for clarity or at least brevity.\n\nEdit: just read this for the article.\n\nThe president said he will speak with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as well as Mexico leadership, not specifying who, on Monday morning.\n\nFuck you Trump. You and your whole administration.",

The ability for career politicians to make a middle management salary and yet magically become multi-millionaires is what drives a lot of people to get into politics.  And those are the wrong people you want making decisions.\n\nIf you shut down all the shady ways politicians can make money outside of their actual job salary, a lot of things would change quickly in this country.\n\nBut - it's all never going to happen.  To outlaw insider trading or lobbying dollars means the very people who benefit the most would need to vote to cut off their own legs.",

Overturn/fix Citizens United - get the firehose of donor money out of politics\n5. Ranked choice voting - this encourages moderation and down regulates the ability of extreme candidates to rise to the top (e.g.: Trump -- he won the 2016 primaries because everyone else broke up any sort of mainstream consensus and let the extreme candidate win a plurality) – it also helps reduce the influence of the two-party system.\n6. Reduce the influence of lobbyists. \n7. Insider trading in congress - important but they get rich as a side effect of being there, not as much as bribes for decisions made (though they may make decisions to benefit their portfolios).\n8. Consider updating the headcount in the house to return it to more representative levels as it had previously been, rather than being capped at 435. – More voices can help break us from this mess.\n\nI'd definitely put insider trading below most of those things.

        "body": "The best way I’ve seen it put is a quote I ~~shamelessly stole~~ saved from another thread:\n\n“I’m going to get a little wonky and write about Donald Trump and negotiations. For those who don’t know, I’m an adjunct professor at Indiana University - Robert H. McKinney School of Law and I teach negotiations. Okay, here goes.\n\nTrump, as most of us know, is the credited author of “The Art of the Deal,” a book that was actually ghost written by a man named Tony Schwartz, who was given access to Trump and wrote based upon his observations. If you’ve read The Art of the Deal, or if you’ve followed Trump lately, you’ll know, even if you didn’t know the label, that he sees all dealmaking as what we call “distributive bargaining.”\n\nDistributive bargaining always has a winner and a loser. It happens when there is a fixed quantity of something and two sides are fighting over how it gets distributed. Think of it as a pie and you’re fighting over who gets how many pieces. In Trump’s world, the bargaining was for a building, or for the construction work, or subcontractors. He perceives a successful bargain as one in which there is a winner and a loser, so if he pays less than the seller wants, he wins. The more he saves the more he wins.\n\nThe other type of bargaining is called integrative bargaining. In integrative bargaining the two sides don’t have a complete conflict of interest, and it is possible to reach mutually beneficial agreements. Think of it, not a single pie to be divided by two hungry people, but as a baker and a caterer negotiating over how many pies will be baked at what prices, and the nature of their ongoing relationship after this one gig is over.\n\nThe problem with Trump is that he sees only distributive bargaining in an international world that requires integrative bargaining. He can raise tariffs, but so can other countries. He can’t demand they not respond. There is no defined end to the negotiation and there is no simple winner and loser. There are always more pies to be baked. Further, negotiations aren’t binary. China’s choices aren’t (a) buy soybeans from US farmers, or (b) don’t buy soybeans. They can also (c) buy soybeans from Russia, or Argentina, or Brazil, or Canada, etc. That completely strips the distributive bargainer of his power to win or lose, to control the negotiation.\n\nOne of the risks of distributive bargaining is bad will. In a one-time distributive bargain, e.g. negotiating with the cabinet maker in your casino about whether you’re going to pay his whole bill or demand a discount, you don’t have to worry about your ongoing credibility or the next deal. If you do that to the cabinet maker, you can bet he won’t agree to do the cabinets in your next casino, and you’re going to have to find another cabinet maker.\n\nThere isn’t another Canada.\n\nSo when you approach international negotiation, in a world as complex as ours, with integrated economies and multiple buyers and sellers, you simply must approach them through integrative bargaining. If you attempt distributive bargaining, success is  impossible. And we see that already.\n\nTrump has raised tariffs on China. China responded, in addition to raising tariffs on US goods, by dropping all its soybean orders from the US and buying them from Russia. The effect is not only to cause tremendous harm to US farmers, but also to increase Russian revenue, making Russia less susceptible to sanctions and boycotts, increasing its economic and political power in the world, and reducing ours. Trump saw steel and aluminum and thought it would be an easy win, BECAUSE HE SAW ONLY STEEL AND ALUMINUM - HE SEES EVERY NEGOTIATION AS DISTRIBUTIVE. China saw it as integrative, and integrated Russia and its soybean purchase orders into a far more complex negotiation ecosystem.\n\nTrump has the same weakness politically. For every winner there must be a loser. And that’s just not how politics works, not over the long run.\n\nFor people who study negotiations, this is incredibly basic stuff, negotiations 101, definitions you learn before you even start talking about styles and tactics. And here’s another huge problem for us.\n\nTrump is utterly convinced that his experience in a closely held real estate company has prepared him to run a nation, and therefore he rejects the advice of people who spent entire careers studying the nuances of international negotiations and diplomacy. But the leaders on the other side of the table have not eschewed expertise, they have embraced it. And that means they look at Trump and, given his very limited tool chest and his blindly distributive understanding of negotiation, they know exactly what he is going to do and exactly how to respond to it.\n\nFrom a professional negotiation point of view, Trump isn’t even bringing checkers to a chess match. He’s bringing a quarter that he insists on flipping for heads or tails, while everybody else is studying the chess board to decide whether its better to open with Najdorf or Grünfeld.”\n\n— David Honig",

I have $100 worth of gold and you have $100 worth of currency. But if we’re different countries it’s labeled a “trade deficit”. \n\nHaving a trade deficit with one country is totally irrelevant if your balance of trade across all countries is in line. The problem arises when you’re giving the world a whole bunch of your currency but then you don’t have anything they want to buy with it: your currency value tanks and now you can’t buy anything anymore (simplistically). \n\nBut for the USA even that hasn’t been an issue because of the special nature of the US dollar. Other countries use our currency to trade between one another.\n\nSo ya, a trade deficit with a specific country is fine. A global trade deficit can be bad, but isn’t even that bad for the USA anyway.\n\nEdit to add: Tariffs are not useless. Their use is political. You’re intentionally creating an inefficiency to change behavior. Which may be the most efficient way to get that behavior but it’s still at a cost (to literally everyone since it’s a global economy; the only difference is to what degree you’re separated from it).",

There's an element of Trumpian chaos (which will hopefully contribute to the downfall) but there are very smart people with definite agendas influencing decisions.

It's like a dumpster fire inside an authoritarian takeover, inside a clownshow being put on by a set of unknown puppetmasters.\n\nThe stuff happening out in front is bad on it's own, but there's way more to it, and the decisions that look so obviously stupid should be understood as the tell that there's something bigger in play, not the play itself.",

        "body": "Trump is not, and never has been the economic genius he's touted as by both him and his supporters. And the point needs to be driven home that he, in fact, wasn't \"better for the economy\"\n\n- Trump inherited a growing economy. All he had to do was ride those coattails, but as soon as a real crisis emerged—the covid pandemic—he mismanaged it at every turn and left office with the economy in tatters. While in the aftermath, he succeeded in scapegoating others like Dr Fauci and Joe Biden. What's frustrating, is that Trump will be inheriting a growing economy for the second time.\n\n- An economic crisis occurred at the end of the last two Republican administrations. A democrat president stepped in both times and was forced to oversee an economic recovery and handle the subsequent fallout. Republicans exploited both opportunities to point fingers at their opponents, choosing to take advantage of a crisis for political gain and campaign talking points.\n\n- Under Trump, the national debt ballooned by nearly 40% \n\n- Trump's tax cuts legislation, which disproportionately and permanently benefited the rich and corporations, did not \"pay for itself,\" and has/will cost the government an estimated trillions.\n\n- Trump put pressure on the fed to keep interest rates low for a political edge. This only worsened inflationary issues.\n\n- The Trump administration hamstringed the labor movement, made it more difficult for workers to unionize and operate effectively.\n\n- Trump didn't just mismanage the pandemic, but he shirked responsibility and encouraged his supporters to politicize every aspect of COVID, dividing Americans during a time of crisis.\n\n- Trump started a trade war with China and his tariff policies were disastrous for Americans.\n\n*It must be emphasized that all of these things and more contributed to economic and inflationary issues that extended into the Biden administration.*\n\nNow, to elaborate more on Trump's tariffs.\n\nMost economists agree that tariffs, especially if they're not carefully implemented, generally do more harm than good, and disproportionately hurt lower income Americans.\n\nThis was made evident by Trump's tariff policies and the trade war he instigated during his presidency. To put it simply, it hurt Americans BIGLY. \n\nAnd now he's proposing higher, across the board tariffs that will have even worse economic impacts.\n\nWe haven't seen tariff policies like this since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which accelerated the Great Depression and brought global trade to a stand still.\n\nThe process of determining tariff rates is a delicate one, and a process that Trump couldn't be bothered with. It should involve complex negotiations and careful considerations. Things Trump couldn't care less about. This is precisely why the Biden/Harris administration was forced to reform Trump's tariff policies, adopting a more calculated approach. One that could not simply reverse Trump's policies *because* of the risks involved.\n\nTrump's tariffs have and will generate economic tensions, raise prices, hurt domestic industries and pass costs down to the consumer.\n\nThey will also hurt rural communities just as much, if not more than they will Americans living in cities. While small businesses will face economic challenges of their own as they have fewer resources and less power to manage the consequences.\n\n> In general, it is believed that Trump’s tariffs did more harm than good, costing companies billions of dollars and reducing the demand for exported goods that were hit with retaliatory tariffs.\n\n> In a survey of economists conducted by Reuters, the Trump administration’s tariffs were very poorly received. Almost 80% of the 60 economists surveyed believed that the tariffs... would actually harm the U.S. economy... All in all, none of the economists surveyed thought that the tariffs would benefit the economy.\n\n> A CNBC study discovered that Trump’s tariffs actually hurt consumers greatly and equaled one of the largest U.S. tax increases in decades. Researchers have also found that the Trump tariffs lowered the real income of American workers and reduced GDP. In 2021, the Biden administration worked to undo many of these harmful trade barriers.\n\nAnd when it comes to the trade deficit that Trump blames Biden for:\n\n***The U.S. trade deficit grew under Trump’s tariffs, from $481 billion in 2016 to $679 billion in 2020.***\n\nThe trade war Trump started targeted American farmers and agricultural workers in the Midwest most of all, These are the same political groups that voted for him in droves.\n\nAs the trade war continued:\n\n> tariffs were also shown to reduce employment and economic output, impacting the overall U.S. economy and people’s livelihoods. The tariffs also did significant damage to relationships with other countries, particularly allies\n\nTrump's current tariff policies have been picked apart by most economists, and the consequences are estimated to be severe. This is what Harris was talking about when she referred to Trump's \"national sales tax.\" Most of the damage is expected to trickle down to consumers and small businesses. While it's very likely that Trump doesn't even know how tariffs work.\n\nTrump is not an \"economic genius,\" he is a notorious financial fraud who lies about his wealth and threatens to sue anyone who speculates about his *real* worth. He's bankrupted or crippled practically every business, product or service he's tried to slap his name on.\n\nTrump has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of them including financial crimes.\n\nTax information also shows that over a period of time in the 80s and 90s, Trump had lost more money than any other American taxpayer. What a loser! Literally...\n\nHere's a long list of Trump's business failures:\n\n- Trump Casinos and Hotels \n- Trump University (The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative)\n- Trump Magazine\n- Trump Airlines\n- Trump Beverages\n- Trump \"The Game\" (yes a Donald Trump boardgame)\n- Trump Mortgages\n- Trump Steaks\n- Trump Travel Site\n- Trumpnet\n- Trump Tower Tampa\n- Trump Vodka\n- Trump Fragrances\n- Trump Mattress\n- Trump Network\n- Tour de Trump\n- Trumped! (Trump Radio)\n- Truth Social (why not call it \"Trump Social\" at this point?)\n\nDonald Trump is not some financial guru, his administrations \"economic achievements,\" by most metrics, benefitted the rich at the expense of everyone else. His greatest financial achievement was inheriting daddy's empire.\n\nBefore The Apprentice, Trump had squandered his riches, and if it weren't for his lucky reality TV show break, he'd be known as the failure he was always destined to be.\n\nThe next Trump administration will destroy what's left of the labor movement, which has been in steady decline ever since Reagan stepped into office. Don't forget Trump's recent remarks in front of a crowd of union workers, where he said he \"hated\" giving overtime pay.\n\nOver the next four years, the MAGA coalition will use Trump to implement an agenda that will continue to redistribute wealth to the top, an agenda that Republicans have been working towards for decades.\n\nEven Trump's immigration policies, and his plan for the \"mass deportation\" of immigrants, will reduce our economy, as it's estimated that Immigrants add trillions of dollars to our GDP. And make no mistake, the new Trump administration will have *all* immigrants in their sights.",

Then BOOM 2016 Trump gets in & we know the story from there (COVID wiping out what's well established as what's supposed to be some of your best years in life, when you buy a house, get married, have kids, move up the career ladder, etc...)           \n\n\nSo from the time elder millennials were exiting HS (those late 30s- early 40s, graduating around 2000-2005), we've been completely 💩 on! Maybe 4-8 yrs the most of \"stability\" for our ENTIRE 20 yrs or so of adult life... We got completely screwed, by REPUBLICANS SPECIFICALLY & should be pissed.          \n\n\nThat's the one thing though that does give me hope about everything -- millennials aren't going to want to keep doing this much longer. We're getting too old to \"wait and see\", hoping things get \"better\" -- when? When we're fkn 50?! It's already almost too late. Half my peers, at fkn 40, aren't even living adult lives because of this 💩 going on. We need it better now. I do think people are going to fight back. The bigger problem is keeping Republicans out of office for good once they are out. No more allowing political amnesia & going back to them. At least I hope so because we're going to end up the lost generation in the history books if it's not addressed. The ones that didn't amount to much because we were always in a REPUBLICAN CAUSED FINANCIAL CRASH.                         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n           ",
