The federal government, through the Court’s ruling, signaled that the people of each state should determine their own course on some of the most consequential issues of our time. That was the rationale, state autonomy, local control, democratic self-determination.\n\nNow, California seeks to do just that. Faced with sweeping tariffs that threaten the livelihood of its farmers and manufacturers, the state is exploring ways to shield its economy. But if the federal government refuses to allow it, or worse, actively blocks those efforts, then we are left with a troubling inconsistency.\n\nThe principle of states' rights cannot be a one-way street. It cannot apply to some issues and not others, depending on the politics of the moment. If states are trusted to regulate matters of life and liberty, they ought to be trusted to protect their workers and industries. To deny that now is not only inconsistent, it is hypocritical.",

I couldn't remember the exact stats but it was a sizeable amount.\n\nThey immediately pivoted to that being why Californians' vote shouldn't count as much, because they didn't understand as much about other issues.\n\nYou can't win when somebody makes up the rules as they go along 🤷‍♂️",

It's not my area of expertise, but at least one way to do it that would be completely constitutional would be to convince other countries to exempt specific products - that just happen to primarily be made in California - from their tariffs. For example, China imposes a 34% tariff on American agricultural products *except almonds*, which it exempts. Good for California, which produces 80% of the world's almonds. Totally constitutional, as it's not some sort of per-state treaty.\n\nI'm not sure how California would do the reverse. Perhaps a state subsidy on particular products (that it primarily imports from China)? That would be legal.",

And who feels the brunt of that the most? Lower-income households, who spend a higher percentage of their earnings on necessities.\n\nSo while the ultra-wealthy enjoy their tax cuts, the poor and middle class will foot the bill through higher prices on food, cars, and consumer goods.

America is perfect and is the saviour to all these other nations. They ignore the way that indigenous folks were treated by Americans. The way they only got involved in the world war very late and did some dodgy stuff and then accepted Nazi scientists and other folks. Never really talk about the horrors of the KKK and how easy it is for cults to start in America and how to be vigilant.\nKnowledge is power. And knowledge is being kept from people to the extent that many Americans don't understand the history of the country never mind countries that interacted with America in history. Never mind geography and global politics and science and languages.\n\nThis is how people refuse to believe the holocaust was real, refuse to believe in basic science and common sense and how neo-naziism spawns in a country that is supposed to be the main character hero of the story of planet earth.",

He also characterized this as a \"subsidy.\"\n\nMost people who stayed awake through high school understand that the trade deficit (how much Canada imports from the USA vs how much the USA imports from Canada) is a natural consequence of the two countries' respective population; there a simply ~10X more customers on the southern side of the border, so it could hardly be otherwise.\n\nFar from being ripped off, decades of negotiations have created many trade agreements with very favourable conditions for the USA.\n\nParadoxically, Trump insists that the U.S.A doesn't *need* Canadian products or resources.  It will be interesting to see how U.S. construction goes without Canadian lumber, and what kind of impact having to pay tariffs on potash have on their agricultural industry.  (More than three quarters of US potash imports come from Canada.  They are able to produce about 1/20th that they need domestically.\n\n\"Elect me, I'll make groceries affordable!\"  \"How?\"  \"Well, first we're going to deport all the migrant workers whose cheap labour you've come to take for granted, and then we're going to alienate our closest trading partner so farmers pay more for fertilizer.  We'll also get rid of woke regulations and absolutely decimate your livestock and create all kinds of product recalls when contamination finds its way into the food supply - it's going to be amazing, you'll love it.\"",

Paxton—an expert in Nazi Germany, Mussolini’s Italy, and Vichy France—published these “ten elements” in his *The Anatomy of Fascism* (2004) to recognize when a democracy ceases to be liberal and embraces fascism. Here they are:\n\n1. A Sense of Crisis: Fascist movements emerge in times of perceived national decline or crisis, promising renewal and strength.\n\n2. Rejection of Liberal Democracy: Fascists view democracy, pluralism, and individual rights as weak and ineffective, advocating instead for an authoritarian state.\n\n3. The Cult of Action for Action’s Sake: Violence and action are glorified as expressions of strength and decisiveness, often at the expense of intellectual debate or deliberation.\n\n4. An Exclusionary Nationalism: Fascism promotes an extreme form of nationalism that defines the nation in ethnocultural terms and excludes perceived outsiders.\n\n5. Glorification of a Mythic Past: Fascists appeal to an idealized version of history, often emphasizing a lost golden age that must be restored.\n\n6. A Leader-Centered Movement: Fascist regimes rely on charismatic leaders who embody the movement and claim to speak for the nation.\n\n7. Militarization of Politics: Fascists use paramilitary groups, intimidation, and violence to achieve political goals.\n\n8. Hostility to Leftist Movements: Fascists strongly oppose socialism, Marxism, and labor movements, often aligning with conservative elites to suppress leftist threats.\n\n9. Economic Control in Service of the State: Fascist regimes do not abolish private property but subordinate economic activity to the needs of the state, often in cooperation with industrialists.\n\n10. Manipulation of Electoral and Legal Systems: Even when coming to power through legal means, fascists work to dismantle democratic institutions once in control.\n\nTrump is *absolutely* a fascist.",

First problem is that there are (almost) no US businesses directly in a lot of these markets now. So now first, the prices on everything would have to go way up, until it's high enough for some person to decide its worth the risk to create a company to fill in that market and compete.  Then they'd have to create the business, manufacturing, the material sourcing, the labor pool, etc, etc and then get it going and producing the goods and then get them on selves to be bought.  Even then in the end of the day the prices would be HIGHER because that's why they can compete now.\n\nThe risk for someone doing all that is huge too because they are existing entirely because the tariffs are making a space for them to compete and if the tariffs ever go away then suddenly their business collapses.",

I would be so sad to lose him, but I hope he becomes Prime Minister one day. \n\nHe’s built on the $10 a Day ChildCare Program, making it so families don’t have to pay over $200 a month for full time childcare. He also made prescription contraceptive free in 2023 and now pharmacies can prescribe prescriptions for 21 different things, taking pressure off of doctors.

The Republicans have been doing this for years, and its clearly working for them. I'm not saying that Democrats should start outright breaking the law or anything, but \"taking the high road\" clearly isn't working.\n\nEven if we manage to have another presidential election in 4 years, I have no faith in the Democrats to turn things around.

The feds will go back to paying these people, just with much, much fewer benefits; such as pensions, PTO, decent healthcare, labor protections, and other perks.\n\nThey'll blame the democrats for the initial layoffs due to their \"decades of bloated, liberal spending\" or whatever bs they conjure, but then will take credit for the 10-15 million new private sector jobs the conservatives created via these contractors.  Some of these laid-off workers will take an early retirement, but the remainder who do not find jobs will just be ignored on whichever slanted, misleading, TikTok or Fox News infographic du jour they shove in our faces.\n\nShareholders and the ownership class will reap the benefits, while the decrease in the federal budget will be negligible, due to middle-men taking their cuts.\n\nAll current conservative policies terminate at the same two endpoints: 1) further enriching shareholders and the already wealthy, or 2) punishing the lazy or immoral.

But of course he can't just let USA bully them so they need to act accordingly. Lots of the tarrifs seem like things Canadians can replace with their own items. A lot of the specifics were geared towards republican states. He mentioned it will distrupt American auto making. Both countries trade car parts back and forth...\n\nCritical minerals were also mentioned a lot, but it doesn't sound like those will used against America yet but it's on the table.\n\n\nTrudeau agreed about the need to tackle fentanyl and wished it was wiped off the face of the earth. So there's common ground there. He emphasized this isn't a Canada issue, this is a joint issue. And it sounds like he wants to work with America. He mentioned the Canada/USA boarder only accounts for 1% of the illegal crossings. \n\nCanada is 1/9 the population and 1/12 the economy compared to USA. But Canada, Mexico and China account up to more than 40% of USA's trade. Interesting to see what China and Mexico do too. This isn't pretty. Hopefully it doesn't last long. ",

This makes it possible to issue tariff exemptions to businesses connected to party insiders, loyalists, or anyone who can afford an appropriately sized \"donation\", ensuring those businesses can operate unaffected while their competitors who don't have exemptions get punished by being economically squeezed, losing customers, or in the worst case going bankrupt. At this point the exempted businesses can purchase their failed competitor's assets and market share at a significantly reduced rate allowing them to expand and become even more successful than they were prior to tariffs being imposed. \n\nThis kind of system where the President has the power to directly reward or punish individual businesses has the potential to create a kind of shadow \"controlled economy\", with a corrupt administration picking winners and losers, which ironically is exactly the kind of system that free market Republicans and conservatives have always claimed to vehemently oppose.",

That's not \"work hard and get rewarded!\" type money. Not even \"Won the lottery\" money. It's the kind of money you earn by stepping on everyone you work with and conning anyone who trusts you. It's the kind of money you earn though child labor, slave labor, human trafficking, and/or complete disregard for human life (the \"it would cost us $5 more to make sure this mother of 4 gets her cancer treatment, so let her die\" type disregard.)\n\nThere are no good billionaires because good people generally cannot become billionaires. \n\nImagine you live in a fantasy novel, and anyone can obtain magic powers if they just murder one thousand innocent babies. When someone asks \"why are there no good wizards?\" then there's your answer, a good person cannot do the things required to reach that level of power. Same thing with real life billionaires.",

We used to imagine, and it wasn't so completely off base, that we could at least kind of predict a few years, maybe even a decade into the future in the study of international relations. Some of the extremely pompous Big Men of the discipline thought they could predict into eternity, but they were always idiots high on their own supply, because we're dealing with units and structures that didn't even exist before the inter-war period, then gradually came into play in 1945 and through the 1960s. \n\nBut now it's like the long-term weather forecast. Anything further than a week ahead, you don't take too seriously, because so many variables can shift in that time. The game has changed, we don't know why the most powerful players do what they do, we don't know who or what might contain them domestically, we don't know if we can count on international allies, and we don't know if we can do anything to change what they do.\n\nIf you just mean it's not a good time for North America when all that is accurate, then I agree. But if you take issue with him stating those facts, we are in less of an alignment.\n\nThe one thing we can take charge of is ourselves. Despite all of the above, I still think the greatest single risk to Canada is the risk that, in fighting monsters, we become fascist ourselves. Let us guard against that, look out for those who will be worst affected by the tariffs, and fight fascism in our communities and in our hearts as well as in our international relations.",

It didn't match exit polling by like a 40% swing, which is unheard of. We all know about the voter suppression that happened in 2024, to the tune of 2 million registered Democrats getting lopped off the voter rolls or being denied voting. But that same system was running back in 2020 also, and Trump assumed it would work well enough to put him over the top.\n\nThere was a recent article about Nevada machines (in 2024) suddenly spitting out perfect lines of 60% trump, 40% Harris after a machine had tabulated a certain number of votes. The scatter graphs turned into straight lines, which again is unheard of. Both Trump and Musk have made jokes about cracking voting machines in the 2024 election. \n\nSo, Trump learned his lesson from 2020 and did better this time.",

History has made us friends, economics has made us partners and necessity has made us allies. \nThat rang true for many decades prior to President Kennedy’s time in office, and in the decades since, from the beaches of Normandy to the mountains of the Korean Peninsula, from the fields of Flanders to the streets of Kandahar, we have fought and died alongside you during your darkest hours during the Iranian hostage crisis. Those 444 days, we worked around the clock from our embassy to get your innocent compatriots home.  During the summer of 2005, when Hurricane Katrina ravaged your great city of New Orleans, or mere weeks ago when we sent water bombers to tackle the wildfires in California. During the day, the world stood still,  Sept. 11, 2001, when we provided refuge to stranded passengers and planes. We were always there, standing with you, grieving with you. The American people.”",

    "selftext": "https://newrepublic.com/post/192261/fox-news-stock-market-tanks-trump-press-conference\n\n>While Donald Trump took questions from the press at the White House Monday afternoon, the stock market plummeted, and Fox News displayed a graphic showing the dip while carrying Trump’s remarks live. \n\n>Trump told reporters that he planned to enact his long-threatened 25 percent tariffs against goods from Mexico and Canada and 10 percent tariffs against goods from China starting Tuesday, to which the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 did not respond well. Fox News, along with their usual breaking news chyron, also had the Dow index displayed while Trump was speaking, showing a fall of more than 650 points.\n\n>Trump’s remarks were preceded by his early afternoon announcement on Truth Social addressed to “the Great Farmers of the United States.” \n\n>“Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States. Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!” Trump posted. But it seems that there was little fun to be had in the stock market based on the fears of higher prices and other  negative ripple effects.\n\n>This, coupled with fewer food imports from three of America’s largest trading partners, will ultimately lead to higher food prices across the country, something that Trump campaigned against during the 2024 election and that ultimately played a factor in his victory. Plus, the prices of various other goods, from cars to electronics to over-the-counter pills, also will likely see a sharp increase. \n\n>Don’t expect Trump to take responsibility for a sinking stock market or higher prices, though. He’s already saying that rising inflation isn’t his fault and has tacitly admitted that his tariffs will cause prices to go up. His administration is even discussing how to juke economic numbers to try and hide how badly Trump’s radical changes, including those from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, are hurting the economy. It looks like our wallets are about to have a rough spring.",

I would say 95% of everyone that voted for him are *still* rabidly supporting every decision he's made so far, despite empirical evidence that he's hurting everyone and not just the \"people he promised to hurt.\" They're taking it as acceptable losses for what needs to get done to \"fix\" broken systems in government (defunding Medicare, Social Security) and to firmly establish \"America First\" (withdrawing from NATO, ending Ukraine aid).\n\nHis voters lack **critical** **thinking** skills. They are, simply put, illiterate by every conceivable metric. So it will be when Trump tangibly hurts them across multiple avenues of their lives is when they finally put two and two together that, \"Oh, hey, this guy doesn't actually have my best interest at heart...\" They'll never figure out that Democrats and other Liberal-minded people have been telling them this since 2015. That, or they'll refuse to accept it. \n\nOf course, by that time, damage is done--permanent. I'm pretty sure Trump will be in Moscow by the time American cities are *legitimately on fire* and there are mass droves of people calling for blood. I hope it doesn't come to that, but at this rate? Man...\n\nI honestly don't have a good outlook on what's to come. The only guarantee I have about what comes next is that the US will no longer be a world superpower. The only thing we'll have going forward is a vast arsenal of nuclear weapons, and right now, Putin is the one that controls that trigger because he controls Trump.",

Yeah, I haven’t had high paying jobs because I don’t have any “technical experience” and transferable skills aren’t seen as holding any value… but I don’t regret it even a little bit. I learned critical thinking skills that I don’t see often in everyday interactions, I learned *how* to think. \n\nEmpiricism is one of the most valuable tools in critical thinking. I believe capitalism fuels consumerism in such high levels that people are consuming information like m&m’s without taking any thought about where/how/why that information was derived. \n\nMany people who say “I’m a man of science” or that science is their highest form of belief bc it’s the “only accurate measure of truths” aren’t even cognizant of the idea that science inherently holds bias because humans are doing science. People use their own bias to determine how/why/what science is done. & that’s how/why in 2024(?) we find out that much of health science (sleep science, reproductive science) hasn’t even considered to use women’s sleep patterns or actual menstrual blood for testing products. Why? Because for so long, STEM was a male dominated field. \n\nEveryone wants to mock about the patriarchy and they don’t realize it’s running this country into the fucking ground. Trump Supporters, look at your gRaNd mAsTeR aLpHa KKKing PATRIARCH & how he’s brought our country to revolution & possible civil war! We have dwindling allies and social support & our taxes aren’t used for anything to benefit us or our lives. Literally taxation without representation thanks to the grand pa(thetic)triarch, Donald Trump :) \n\nBut it’s okay because I’m probably just a lib-tard for taking these views (I don’t believe in either side of this government because they’re all corrupt money hungry oligarchs and two opposing colors won’t change my mind and force me to pick a side). \n\nThere I said my piece & I’m done. Enjoy the rest of this cake 🎂\n\nedited to diss Trump one more time & correct some errors",

I also have to have eye surgery in both eyes due to being diagnosed with keratoconus during my eye exam. I haven’t even seen a regular physician yet either. The soonest they could schedule me for an exam is in May. Who knows what they’ll find and what appointments I’ll need after that.

His voice, made metallic by the amplifiers, boomed forth an endless catalogue of atrocities, massacres, deportations, lootings, rapings, torture of prisoners, bombing of civilians, lying propaganda, unjust aggressions, broken treaties. It was almost impossible to listen to him without being first convinced and then maddened. At every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the voice of the speaker was drowned by a wild beast-like roaring that rose uncontrollably from thousands of throats. The most savage yells of all came from the schoolchildren. **The speech had been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when a messenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap of paper was slipped into the speaker's hand. He unrolled and read it without pausing in his speech. Nothing altered in his voice or manner, or in the content of what he was saying, but suddenly the names were different. Without words said, a wave of understanding rippled through the crowd. Oceania was at war with Eastasia!** The next moment there was a tremendous commotion. The banners and posters with which the square was decorated were all wrong! Quite half of them had the wrong faces on them. It was sabotage! The agents of Goldstein had been at work! There was a riotous interlude while posters were ripped from the walls, banners torn to shreds and trampled underfoot. The Spies performed prodigies of activity in clambering over the rooftops and cutting the streamers that fluttered from the chimneys. But within two or three minutes it was all over. The orator, still gripping the neck of the microphone, his shoulders hunched forward, his free hand clawing at the air, had gone straight on with his speech. One minute more, and the feral roars of rage were again bursting from the crowd. **The Hate continued exactly as before, except that the target had been changed.** \n\nNineteen Eighty Four, George Orwell",

Remind people that it is in the country’s best interests to diversify outside of the American sphere. Contribute to company policy. \n\nGet involved in local politics. Get to know your representatives and their rivals. Take solace when you discover that most of them are actually trying to make the country better. Find out whose platform best meshes with your own ideals. Give feedback. When elections happen, be sure to vote and make sure that vote is an informed one. \n\nNone of these things are Herculanian tasks, but the aggregate of everyone following a similar strategy will help keep the nation sane.

How easily they are shepherded into hating their neighbor on the decree of their king. I thought it was bad when Bush whipped up anti-Iraq fervor based on lies, but at least that had the underpinnings of a recent attack and blatant racism. This is purely \"you hate these people that look and sound basically just like you, because I said so.\"\n\nIt's not a good sign. And you are right about how accurate that is. Far too many Americans are quite proudly ignorant, and it's by design, because many others are proudly evil.",

I said over and over again during his first administration that Trump's supporters didn't want a physical wall between the US and Mexico, they wanted a rhetorical wall. They wanted to know that their president was doing something about what they saw as a problem. It REALLY didn't matter to them if it got done, or who would pay for it. The arguments over who would pay for it were a stupid distraction. \n\nI think this tariff thing is the same deal: Trump doesn't care if it works. He has convinced his supporters that the rest of the world is ripping them off, and he is doing something about it; and that's ALL they want. Trump doesn't care about the negative affects of a tariff. But if he doesn't implement them, he's forced to admit that 1) the rest of the world isn't really ripping us off, and 2) that policy and legislation are really the only things that work to make life better for citizens, and yeah, it sucks that there's no quicker way, but that's just reality.",

It's why I was worried about a President coming in with tariffs being his big campaign issue, when he clearly didn't seem to understand exactly how they worked. There is a lot I'm concerned with, and my future in this country, and this country's future in the world is what concerns me, and it's more concerning that you're scared of a black woman than you are a lying idiot who's been making shit up from the start\". \n\nWe didn't really get past that, but it's somehow become even more depressing than I had expected. I didn't foresee him actually threatening Canada with invasion and forcing them to become a 51st state (an idea that is stupid itself, since they have ten provinces themselves...). I wish I hadn't pretty much nailed how he would handle Ukraine, but even I couldn't have predicted that he would invite Zelenskyy to what felt like an ambush interview with that clown Vance. \n\nIt's frustrating, because I really tried to reach both of my parents on why I understood they weren't going to become Democrats, but I figured they would at least *not support someone like Trump.* But its' tough. They're both deeply religious, and it's hard to reason someone out of those positions that they attach to their religion. Even when my Mom half-jokingly says \"What made you this way!?\" to me when we're talking politics and I have to just say \"YOU! YOU DID THIS! REMEMBER!? All of the times you took me to church and told me that it was important to care for others, to protect people who can't protect themselves, to provide for people who are struggling to provide for themselves, not because it's beneficial to you, but because it's right. All the times you took me to the library and told me to just go nuts and I'd come back with books stacked to my chin. When you took me to school to meet with my teachers, because you wanted them to pay attention to the fact that I had a learning disability and they weren't helping. All of those things you spent time drilling into my head are things you're just happily voting against now...\".",

They effectively shut down parts of the government that provide aid to other countries or even just not tell the people what is going on health-wise by basically shutting down the CDC's press website page. We got pulled out of the World Health Organization, which is used by all countries to help stop and control diseases around the world. The Department of Education is on the brink of being shut down. Various parts of the government are being stripped down to skeleton crews. Oh and that is just the National stuff I didn't even get to the international stuff.

When asked how, he said he'd only pay back 80% of what they owed.

That's definitely not the same product. \n\nThe stitching is awful quality and they're probably the cheapest looking pieces of shit I've ever seen.\n\nThe seams are so bulky which is terrible on athletic clothing because it gives you rashes and chafing. \nI've never touched anything so uncomfortable in my life.\n\nPlus they have been astroturfing on fashion subs since their inception.",
