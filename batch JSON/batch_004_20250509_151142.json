    "selftext": "Not even a fucking year ago I moved to this city specifically for this job. It was as close to a dream job as I could ask for: it was a small company (less than 10 employees), non-corporate, it shared the same values I did, and all of of my coworkers were just beyond fantastic, I genuinely couldn’t have asked for much better. I literally never once was written up, in fact my employer had nothing to say except to sing my praises when I would ask for feedback! I did damn good work, and I was proud to work there. \n\nWelp, it was all for fucking nothing. \n\nSince the election, and since the inauguration especially, we have been a lot more open in the office about talking our political beliefs, and exactly none of us were happy with Trump being elected, let alone the daily bombardment of downright crazy shit he’s been doing since 1/20. \n\nCome today, the owner asked me to come in a little early. We had a new employee starting in my department so I just assumed it was related to that, and discussing how the power structure or division of work would happen once they start. Could not have been further from the truth. \n\nHe starts with asking me about my weekend and how I’m feeling (I called out sick Friday) and after some small talk he goes “listen ____, I’ve loved having you work here and you’ve been so stellar in the role and frankly I’ve been so impressed with your work since you started here.  But unfortunately since the election, our business has taken a massive hit financially. Tariffs are screwing us, the markets are crashing, and frankly people aren’t buying our goods like they used to. So we need to reshuffle the company structure a bit, so today will be your last day.”\n\n\nI took this job specifically because it was a place I saw myself long term, it was a place I could be content staying at for more than a few years. I went $20k in debt moving halfway across the fucking country and for this job, just for me to lose it because Donald Fucking Trump has to go and play god emperor with our country. And my now ex-boss did say he would help me find a new job however he could, but like I work in a small niche industry, the odds of finding another job in my city is small to none… \n\nI’m so tired of this fucking country man.

I thought the future would be cooler, but it turns out it's just more of the same shit, flung by the same monkeys.\n\nWe aren't evolving. We are just spinning our wheels until we run out of gas and die.",

        "body": "Oh yeah, I had almost forgotten when he had his last pissing match with China, and also with everyone else in the TPP crashing the domestic soy bean market and making Canadian imported lumber expensive. So they just continue with slashing and burning the rainforest to grow soybeans and pine?\n\nHe was also talking about getting rid of the CHIPs act too. That's what's behind the massive Intel plant being built in OH. We couldn't even begin production of any tech without microchips from China, and we're still a couple years or so from domestic production of them; longer if he screws with CHIPs. Guess we'll just have to accept $3k iPhones for the foreseeable future.\n\nDoes he have any economic advisors who aren't buy, pillage, and declare bankruptcy investment bros? Crops are our biggest physical product we export (we export more crops than anyone else on the world), and China was our biggest trading partner in that regard. China is ~20% of our total agricultural exports. Mexico's #3, and I can see them getting a bit pressed as Trump is talking about sending millions of Hispanic immigrants to Mexico.\n\nSoybeans grow great here. If we could try to convince people that soy won't hurt them (you can't process plant estrogen), and try to popularize soy milk over Almond (growing Almonds wastes so much water in CA), and occasional tofu over meat (healthier, cheaper, more sustainable, and, shelf stable availability). We could improve health and environmental impact as well as an economic growth. Though the last time someone suggested that perhaps we think about reducing our beef intake  and try some more environmentally friendly protein sources, a bunch of Republicans ate a fastfood burger before a crowd to declaring that the green new deal would make burgers illegal, and that you'd have to pry burgers from their cold, dead hands. They're more dramatic than middle schoolers. Influencers can convince people to drink raw milk, I'm sure someone can convince white ladies that tofu is great for clear skin or something.",

Every business importing goods from China still has to pay a 145% tariff right now. That’s the one tariff that isn’t delayed. It is already costing jobs.\n\nThe thing that worries me most is that there is nobody in a position to stop or even influence Trump. It’s Trump all the way down. China will certainly not call. The U.S. is destroying itself economically and handing the crown to China. They simply have to do nothing and just watch.\n\nTrump’s only rule is to never back down and to always double down. This isn’t over. Fox News is still firmly behind Trump. Republicans are firmly behind Trump. It seems he really believes that this all makes sense in the long run. He will bring manufacturing back, screw small businesses that are too weak, screw the services industry, and screw anyone who isn’t with him. He wants to go down in history as the president who changed U.S. trade policy, restored the budget, and solved all of America’s problems—him alone, because he is a genius. If he’s wrong and the U.S. goes into recession, he would be the last person to admit it. He’d blame it on everyone but himself.",

That's all the US system appears to be capable of any more, and without some very serious fundamental reforms, which the founders have made basically impossible to ever implement, it will likely just keep getting worse. \n\nWhich would be alright if the US was just some tiny irrelevant backwater shithole, but unfortunately its geography and demography mean the US will never be irrelevant. To the extent that the US is no longer a net contributor to global stability and prosperity, it will necessarily become a threat to the same.",

Parties are necessary in politics because otherwise you have 400 individual politicians all trying to pass laws by themselves. Then a couple have a similar idea and band together to pass one thing, recruit a couple others who think similarly, and boom you have a party. It's just a natural consequence of running a government.\n\nPlus, the US system pretty much forces a two party government with the electoral college and first past the post elections. So Washington can wax poetic about the evils of party all day, the truth is the founders laid the groundwork for this polarization from the beginning.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nMarket currently is in a Free fall and stocks are going down and wealth is being destroyed like there is no tomorrow and 401k and portfolio of many people is in shambles right now and many startup companies and many companies that are struggling, it is being even more harder for them to stay afloat in this Volatile market.\n\nWhilst all this is happening, you know what has Trump been up to you? \n\nHe has been planning for a very special dinner instead of addressing this very crucial situation that affects all of us. \n\n[Trump headlining $1 million a person super PAC dinner as stocks sink over tariffs](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-hosts-liv-golf-fundraiser-as-stocks-sink-over-tariffs/)\n\nI kinda find it very foul that this administration is doing nothing about this current issue on the hand and is allowing all this Chaos to take place in the market. \n\nThey have done nothing to ease the current situation and if this continues and if truly have black Monday awaiting tomorrow, it would be catastrophic economic crisis caused by the administration and would cause numerous businesses to go bankrupt and spark mass unemployment as a consequence. \n\nVery sad to see this whole situation unfold like this. \n\n\n\n",

They are *causing* the stock market to crash. They are doing in on purpose. It's part of the plan. This is what Trump voters voted for, he's not doing anything he didn't promise during his campaign.\n\nThe current administration doesn't give a shit about your 401k, they want to depress asset prices so their billionaire donors can buy up everything for cheap. Then the tariffs will end and the market will recover and a lot of people will have lost everything by then because they sold at the bottom.",

Fascist regimes often rise to power during periods of social, political or economic instability.  They exploit fear, dissatisfaction and a longing for stability to gain support.  Couple that with propaganda blaming minority groups such as immigrants or gay/trans, extreme nationalism such as the MAGA slogan, and blaming external forces such as being treated very badly by every other nation on earth to create a sense of victimization and self-righteousness and you can see where this is headed.  Fascist regimes will often position themselves as protectors of traditional values as well.\n\n\nI know there’s a lot of political bent out there but seriously do your own research and see how many things this administration has done just happens to check the box.  It’s a playbook we’ve seen before in history.  Smart money would be to reduce exposure and have made plans to protect your portfolio in the event America does end up going further down this road.\n\n\nPersonally I hope we don’t go down the path.  But the whole El Salvador thing has such a weird vibe with parallels to concentration camps it was really that moment for me when it was pretty apparent that this administration knows exactly what they are doing.\n\n\nWhether you love or hate Trump, the wheels are in motion to transform America into a fascist nation.",

I've already \"not lost\" 20% as most of what I sold was Nasdaq, it is time to start locking some of that in.

The White House insists China must make the first move, while Trump believes Beijing will eventually seek a deal to address issues like US exports, fentanyl, and TikTok.

We could give them a blank check and the army corps of engineers to build the fabs and it would still take years of R&D to see anything produced.\n\nAlso the reason China and TSMC often have an edge at the low end of the market is because they're re-purposing the old production lines. They build a new cutting edge plant, then produce jelly-bean ICs out of the old plants at rock bottom prices because the investment already paid itself off essentially. It's just extra profit. If you built a brand new $2b plant to produce commodity microprocessors that sell for $0.11 you'd literally never break even.",

The taxes used to go like this every dollar above 450k 3 million in today's money was taxed at 90% .  It sounds much worse than it is, but that stripped out our biggest influx of tax earnings.

Every red state takes more money than it gives to the federal government except 2 states, Texas and Florida. So maybe we should split into 2 countries no war red states and blue .",

This goes hand in hand with his push to secure minerals in other territories because America doesn't have access to all the minerals its industries do/will need. This in turn goes hand in hand with a view of the world as made up of big players, e.g. china, (Russia?), etc. And he wants America to be self sufficient in its competition with them - rather than dependent on companies/industry/minerals based in other nations. This is, from this perspective, because the post cold war consensus that \"liberal democracy has 'won' and will bring the world prosperity and peace\" is wrong headed and we are now in the post-post-cold-war global reality of a new competition between nations.\n\nHe thinks he can strengthen Americas position against the big global players by bullying the nations in its own orbit - Canada, European nations, etc. into giving America more. \n\nThis is, obviously, a fundamental change in the way America is using its power. \n\nI don't think that this is trump's invention. But as far as I can tell, this is the view of the people around him. Trump's own views seem to be chaotic, mercurial, aimed at making himself popular and/or rich etc etc etc etc. But the ideology that he is the de facto figurehead of (Bannon, Vance, etc.) seems to have this global view.",

        "body": "Agreed. This is not just retail money pumping. It’s orchestrated. I’ve been monitoring options sweeps very closely. Watching the daily flows. This is where the big money makes directional bets. For the last 3 trading days, there is MASSIVE put selling in 0dt OTM strikes. Market opens and I immediately see $50M+ being accumulated and sold in strikes $10 or more OTM in SPY. Example: SPY opens at $538 and I see $547 puts being SOLD hand over fist by big money. Then we close above $547. So not only did they bank on selling deep ITM 0dt puts. They bank on the calls and long positions as well. How can they be so surgical here? \n\nThen you see the sudden buying into EOD. Retail usually buys in the morning and institutional money in the final hour. It’s already been reported that Trump insiders are feeding information to Wall Street. \n\nHard to say what’s happening here. Either they are front running some news drop, or it’s a game to get exit liquidity. Seems like they are gunning to fill that Liberation(Lubrication) Day gap with $560s SPY. \n\nEither way I think a dump is coming when they have fulfilled whatever target price they are going for.",

I urge you both to learn nuance and dig deeper than the political headlines.\n\nTariffs create an additional cost in the supply chain which may or may not hit the customer's price, dependent upon several factors - ie the shape and intersection of the supply and demand curves for the product (this is the core of microeconomics and pricing theory).\n\n**Where is the product within that markets supply-demand curve?**  If the product offers significant consumer value and has little/no competition, then the price is within the space where the supplier can raise prices and the consumer will pay it.   If, on the other hand, the product is below that intersection point or there is competition in the manufacturing of that (or similar) products, then the supplier will be forced to reduce their revenues from their sales - cutting something in their supply chain/overhead/shipping/quality/etc (they have to make that choice).  Often different companies try different strategies until the market hits a new equilibrium.\n\n\n**How quickly can the domestic market adjust?**  Domestic suppliers/manufacturers can react to these transit tariff costs in multiple ways.  Manufacturers can see the higher prices caused by tariffs and (since they don't experience them) can now introduce a product that can compete with the foreign product at a lower price.  **This is ultimately the goal of tariffs**.\n\nIn the end, tariffs are generally a net loss for the global economy, but it's important to understand the geopolitical consequences of tariffs.  Western food tariffs (which are high), for example, particularly combined with farm subsidies, keep domestic food prices low while also ensuring crop failures (which do happen) and transportation disruptions do not cause food shortages in the West (this is a good thing we all now take for granted). \n\nTariffs on microchips can encourage domestic production, preventing supply chain chaos as we saw during COVID, and also ensure the national security can rely on a supply of chips during a crisis. \n\n...but in the modern case, tariffs are being imposed on China due to a burgeoning political/military rivalry.  Both sides of the political spectrum in the West have consolidated on the position that China has used its economic prosperity, driven by Western manufacturing, to bolster their military.  Taiwan is under threat of invasion and the South China seas are being militarized by China at an alarming rate.\n\nAs such, Biden kept the Trump trade tariffs (which Biden likely also would have enacted), and my guess is that both Harris and Trump will raise them again regardless of who wins this election.  It's a way of handicapping an emerging foreign rival.\n\n**tldr** Tariffs are going to increase no matter what because China is building nukes and threatening to invade Taiwan.",

If we could already manufacture something domestically for cheaper than it can be manufactured in Bangladesh, we would be doing that. The idea of domestic manufacturers producing a cheaper product is relative to the tariff inflated prices of foreign products. \n\nAlso, the microchip example is a complex one, since we literally cannot make high end chips in the US any time soon. Intel is going through an economic disaster as they try to develop on shore manufacturing and they aren’t even trying to develop a facility for cutting edge, current generation chips. The timeline to build a facility like what TSMC has is on the scale of decades. It would be good for defense if we could on-shore chip fabrication, but it will be extremely costly to do that and the government (taxpayers) will be paying a lot of the cost either through higher prices or subsidies, likely both. If we only care about the end result for consumers, free trade is the closest thing to a free lunch that exists in the real world. It expands the “efficient frontier” of the global economy by allowing maximum specialization.",

A good tariff should drop off in revenue relatively quickly as consumers move to goods that don't carry the extra cost or whatever advantage the foreign company is leaning on goes away.

If you try to force a person to accept something before the brain is ready you can cause severe trauma. (As in the little boy who was so severely beaten and mistreated by his parents he developed multiple personalities to avoid the pain of reality. Each (personality) of which knew nothing of the other one. I forget his name, but it can be found on the innerwebs). \n\nIt takes a lot of time for truth to seep into a person's mind and for them to accept it as truth. You can't force truth upon them. They have to slowly awaken to it on their own terms and as slow/fast as their intelligence allows.\n\nWhen I read stories such as yours I think of the person you are describing as an child who puts their fingers in their ears and screams \"La La La La!\" so they don't have to hear whatever is causing them distress. \n\nTo loosely quote Bruce Lee, be like the nature of water.

Only takes a majority of Congress, not 2/3 of Senate like this useless impeachment. It stands to reason that after an annulment, all executive actions, appointments, tariffs, and firings he has orchestrated would be reversed, since they were performed by an illegitimate executive branch.  \n\nI don't know how many times it must be repeated until people start demanding accountability, but: Under the 14th Amendment, insurrectionists cannot hold federal office. As such, Trump is an illegitimate President pushing unconstitutional and illegal actions and appointments. If he were to be 14a3'd, it would potentially remove both him and Vance, as they both ran on an illegal ticket. The new POTUS would either be Mike Johnson or Kamala. But the point is: Impeachment is worthless, but the 14th Amendment only requires a handful of Republicans to support the vote. Collins, Murkowski, Valadao, Newhouse -- find 4 more, and the dictatorship is over. Or, Democratic leadership can continue being incompetent, and we continue into the 4th Reich.",

Every industry that is heavily offshored started with some asshole thinking they could get more profits or market share without thinking through to the logical conclusion…that once one company offshores, the rest will soon follow. Then everyone ends up back where they started…making the same profits, but with longer, riskier, more complex supply chains.\n\nThe real problem with this is you’re teaching your future competitors. We’ve seen this incredibly stark reality in China, where Chinese suppliers are now demonstrating the ability to fully design, package, market, and deliver a wide range of very advanced products, including automobiles, advanced cell phones, and a wide range of consumer electronics. And the software folks are not exempt from this either… As they outsource all of their software development and support to India, it won’t be long before Indian companies are competing directly with the likes of Microsoft, Open AI, Oracle, etc. At least on the hardware front, tariffs are an outstanding way to reduce this intellectual property giveaway to future foreign competitors.  I think across-the-board tariffs are incredibly stupid… I see no reason why rubber dog shit and baby shoes should be manufactured in the United States.  However, targeted tariffs involving key industries, and where foreigners are demonstrably dumping or using otherwise unfair trade practices, are a smart and essential tactic…one of a few effective mechanisms we have to address those kinds of problems.",

Some states will be rich, and then there will be poor manufacturing states. The factory owners will live like in Miami, or Vegas or LA or whatever. \n\nPrices will go up, he has already fired federal workers, and destroyed protections, and worker rights, and environmental protections, etc...\nCompanies will have to tighten their belts, and restructure. Many people will be laid off, and jobless. He's driving the country into another great depression.\n\nIf Americans get poor enough that they will work for wages as competitively low as in China or Vietnam or whatever, then it will make sense to build the factories there. \n\nThe money will be easy to find. The government can subsidize. The tariffs will help make people poor and it will help imports be more expensive.\n\nThe major problem with this is that if Americans figure this out, they'll be very pissed and revolt, and other nations especially with Trump making threats of annexation, and being so aggressive and confrontational, they won't want to import American products on principle.\n\nBut Trump will blame Canadians, and Mexicans, and whoever else he wants to invade, and then go to war and try and essentially force these countries to buy his goods. Idk if MAGA will fall for that, but most likely I'd guess they will.\n\nI just don't see how any of this could play out in a positive way. \n\nBest case scenario I can see, is American citizens revolt, states refuse to play ball with the federal government, civil war breaks out, Canada and the free world combine with these freedom states to depose Trump, who, most likely rigged the election in his favour anyway. \n\nI mean, he has said it was easy to do, he alluded to fixing things up so nobody will have to vote for him again, and that he had some secret plans to win.\n\nTrump doesn't want america to be rich. He wants Trump to be rich. He has no issues making all of you dirt poor so he can exploit you, send you to war, make you live as slaves in his factories, so that he can have a bigger palace, a bigger yacht, and a nicer golf course.",

    "selftext": "\nThis isn’t a dip. It’s not a correction. It’s the slow, brutal unraveling of a debt-soaked fantasy we’ve been pretending was sustainable since 2008. The Fed is cornered—rates are high, inflation refuses to die, and there's no bailout coming this time. The only soft landing is for the billionaires with parachutes made of your 401(k).\n\nTech is imploding under the weight of hype and weak fundamentals. AI was a sugar high. Now we’re crashing. Banks are getting shaky. Commercial real estate is a time bomb. And consumers? They're maxed out, broke, and paying 29% on credit cards to buy gas and eggs.\n\nAnd just when we needed stability, we get chaos: Trump’s back in the mix with unhinged tariffs, trade wars 2.0, and economic policies that look like they were scribbled on a napkin in a Denny’s at 3 a.m. Markets hate uncertainty—guess what? That’s all we’ve got now.\n\nThis isn’t a crash. It’s controlled demolition with nobody at the controls.\n\nSell, don’t look back, and maybe plant a garden. We had a good run.\n\nGoodbye, and may whatever comes next be merciful.\n\n",

There's something very bad in the water in this country because everyone continuously assumes everything we've built our country on is a sham house of cards that's about to tip over.

The US, absent Trump, would have continued to be an unequal, politically dysfunctional, but extremely successful and productive country. There is no reason we can't still be that even with all the damage Trump is doing. He's not going to be in office forever and if he fucks up enough, he absolutely will lose his grip on power. Here's the reality check:\n\n>The Fed is cornered—rates are high, inflation refuses to die, and there's no bailout coming this time. The only soft landing is for the billionaires with parachutes made of your 401(k).\n\nThis is the most legitimate part of this post. Tariffs can absolutely cause stagflation and the country is not positioned to give a big bailout right now, deficit-wise. There's a big lesson here about watching deficits and not assuming that interest rates will be low forever, but the Fed still has some ammo and we're seeing some signs of congressional Republicans cracking. If shit gets bad they will absolutely leave Trump for dead to try to save their asses in 2026 in the same way that they lined up to kiss his ass when it benefited them.\n\n>Tech is imploding under the weight of hype and weak fundamentals.\n\nMeta, Google, Microsft, Amazon, and Apple all have rock-solid high margin business models with no competitors besides each other. Maybe they trade at a P/E of 20 or 15 or even 10 instead of 30, but they dominate innovative, high-margin, and still growing businesses.\n\n>AI was a sugar high. Now we’re crashing.\n\nAI is a real technology that will cause actual productivity increases. Productivity increases due to new technologies is the reason everything always goes up and AI is showing us there are more gains to come.\n\n>Banks are getting shaky. \n\nNot really. FDIC, Fed and 2008 said that even if they looked shaky, which they don't really, they'd be bailed out and backstopped.\n\n>Commercial real estate is a time bomb. And consumers? They're maxed out, broke, and paying 29% on credit cards to buy gas and eggs.\n\nThis isn't 2008. Real estate isn't hyper-inflated; there's not enough of it in the places people want to live and work and it's pricing people out.\n\n>And just when we needed stability, we get chaos: Trump’s back in the mix with unhinged tariffs, trade wars 2.0, and economic policies that look like they were scribbled on a napkin in a Denny’s at 3 a.m. Markets hate uncertainty—guess what? That’s all we’ve got now.\n\nYup and the result is a bunch of bright-red days. This policy is so colossally stupid and unnecessary. But this is a manufactured recession. The US wasn't sitting on its last legs before this, the economy and the market both looked pretty damn good. A lot of those fundamentals are still fine",
