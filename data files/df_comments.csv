The US has a big trade deficit because it is so wealthy. Despite all of the complaints, most Americans have a lot of money in international comparison and want to spend it.

Meanwhile the country has nowhere near enough able-bodied unemployed people to produce all of these things domestically. At US wages, it would also be dramatically more expensive - so even though some Americans may find a 'better' job, prices will rise so much that the typical consumer will still be much poorer.

Schiff is the first Senator to openly call for a congressional investigation into potential insider trading by the Trump Administration in the aftermath of the President’s abrupt reversal on the implementation of new tariffs. Such investigations would typically fall under the purview of powerful congressional panels like the Senate Judiciary Committee or the Senate Finance Committee. Both are chaired by Republicans—Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho—who have largely avoided conflict with the White House. Individual lawmakers like Schiff can investigate matters using personal office staff, though such investigations would lack subpoena power.

Why?  Because heavy crude oil is harder to refine so it sells for less but yields more fuel. So US oil companies sell almost all oil they harvest.  Take the profit from that and buy heavy crude oil from the global market to refine.  It is about overall profit for the oil companies.

The Honorable [Representative/Senator's Name][Office Address][City, State, ZIP Code]

Dear [Representative/Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for the Stopping Tariffs on Allies and Bolstering Legislative Exercise of (STABLE) Trade Policy Act, recently introduced by Senators Tim Kaine and Chris Coons. President Trump’s recent tariffs are a spectacularly poor policy choice that increases costs for American consumers and businesses. This legislation would give congress the authority to reverse the tariffs and fight any future attempts to impose them on our allies.

Tariffs have been considered a bad idea by almost every serious economist in the last fifty years. They were partially responsible for causing the Great Depression. Even Trump's closest advisors were opposed to the idea. Congress needs a way to fight against this nonsense.

Trade policies should serve the best interests of the American people and maintain strong international partnerships, not burden them with unnecessary economic hardship. The STABLE Trade Policy Act would ensure that trade policy respects the needs of the country instead of the whims of one man. I urge you to support this legislation and advocate for its swift passage to protect American households from further price hikes.

1ifwraa,majz99l,t1_majqvsf,Mercuryqueen71,"I got this from TikTok,

I am writing to you as a deeply concerned constituent to urge you to take immediate action to hold President Donald Trump accountable for his recent actions, which I believe constitute a gross abuse of executive power, a threat to national security, and a direct assault on the constitutional foundations of our nation. Specifically, I request that you support and advocate for the introduction of articles of impeachment against President Trump for his overreach of Congress’s power of the purse, his unconstitutional attempts to undermine the 14th Amendment, his dangerous executive orders, and his deplorable handling of critical issues that endanger the safety, security, and wellbeing of the American people.
Over the past two weeks, President Trump has repeatedly crossed the line of executive authority, demonstrating a blatant disregard for the rule of law, the separation of povers, and basic human decency. His attempt to freeze federal funding for essential programs, even after a federal judge blocked his order, is a direct assault on Congress’s constitutional power of the purse. This action not only undermines the legislative branch’s authority but also jeopardizes the well-being of millions of Americans who rely on these programs for their livelihoods. His proposed funding cuts to education, healthcare, and other vital services pose a significant risk to our nation’s future, threatening to weaken our economy and leave countless individuals without access to critical resources.
Furthermore, President Trump’s efforts to undermine the 14th Amendment and block birthright citizenship are deeply alarming. The 14th Amendment is a cornerstone of our Constitution, guaranteeing equal protection under the law and affirming the principle of birthright citizenship. By attempting to overturn this fundamental right through executive order, President Trump is not only acting unconstitutionally but also eroding the very principles that define our nation as a land of opportunity and equality. Equally troubling are his threats to deport the native stewards of our land, including Indigencis peoples and long-standing residents who have contributed to the fabric of our society. His administration’s plans to establish concentration camps for migrants at Guantanamo Bay are a horrifying escalation of his inhumane immigration policies.
Such actions are not only morally reprehensible but also a violation of international human rights standards and the values we hold dear as a nation.
President Trump’s response to the recent plane crash, which he directly caused by firing key personnel and using Elon Musk to pressure others qualified key players to step down, was nothing short of deplorable. His reckless actions endangered the lives of innocent civilians and military personnel, and his subsequent attempts to deflect blame and downplay the tragedy demonstrate a shocking lack of leadership and empathy. This incident underscores the dangers of his impulsive decision-making and the urgent need to hold him accountable for his actions.
Additionally, President Trump’s appointment of unqualified nominees to critical positions in government poses a grave risk to o9r r.atonal security and public safety. These individuals lack the expertise and judgment necessary to protect our nation from threats, both foreign and domestic.
Their presence in key roles undermines the integrity of our institutions and puts the lives of Americans at risk.
President Trump’s recent executive orders and actions represent a dangerous escalation of executive overreach. They threaten the checks and balances that are essential to our democracy and set a dangerous precedent for future administrations. If left unchecked, these actions could irreparably harm the integrity of our constitutional system, the rights of all Americans, and the stability of our nation.
I urge you to take a stand against these abuses of power by supporting the introduction of articles of impeachment against President Trump. It is your duty as a member of Congress to uphold the Constitution, protect the rights of your constituents, and ensure the safety and security of our nation. The American people deserve leaders who will defend our democracy and hoid these epower accountable for their actions.
Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I trust that you will act in the best interests of our nation and its people. I look forward to your response and hope to see your leadership in addressing these critical issues.

Трамп was inaugurated on January 20, 2017, and his last day in office was January 19, 2021. Here’s how the Nasdaq Composite performed during his term:

	•	January 20, 2017: 5,555.33
	•	January 19, 2021: 13,197.18

Percent Change Calculation

Percent Change = ((Final Value - Initial Value) / Initial Value) × 100

= ((13,197.18 - 5,555.33) / 5,555.33) × 100

= (7,641.85 / 5,555.33) × 100

= 137.6%

Fascist regimes will often position themselves as protectors of traditional values as well.

Create a crisis, secure *anything* he can re-brand as a concession, declare victory. Other world leaders are literally on the record saying that's exactly how he talks to them--""just give me anything and I'll make this go away.""

Trump knows he didn't achieve anything. But now he's going to take full credit for *everything,* and his media cronies will back him up.

Guys, we're 8 years into this. You need to understand this is intentional.

He holds the world hostage and demands a Bic Mac. **His threats are big and his demands are cheap BY DESIGN.** He knows other countries aren't willing to risk the havoc he's threatening, and the bar is *so low* for ""victory"" that they usually just give him a pittance. He's relying on the world not willing to set itself on fire just to deny him his Big Mac.

And the worst part is it works because he's right. Any leader so stubborn to call his bluff and bring unimaginable harm to the world is a leader just as depraved as him, so stubbornly egotistical as to throw aside all material policy and just enter into a contest of narcissists. The only way to resist his ""diplomacy"" is to be an unimaginable monster who would rather burn thousands of livelihoods to the ground than just let him have his cheap Big Mac.

You can also go to a local private clinic and see a doctor for the equivalent of $5, (in the border prices are higher) and go to the pharmacist to buy what you need.


Further information.


If you work you can even go to IMSS, which is the social security for workers and in my opinion is ultimately the best option (went through 9 surgeries as a kid in the right eye, all done by the IMSS), as it has the best doctors and the best equipment and costs you nothing more than your monthly quota. 


But of course it has its big drawbacks, waiting times can be long, months long, and in some cases they might not have the medicine you need, some personnel can be real assholes, etc. I'd still choose it over any private system because health shouldn't be for profit (and my family has had terrible experience with private healthcare).

1juixt2,mm51pq3,t1_mm3dngw,Capt_Pickhard,"Trump has stated publicly he thinks minimum wage should be left up to the state level to decide. 

Afaict, his plan is to make Americans poor enough that they will fill American factories in states like that, where minimum wage will be very low. Some states will be rich, and then there will be poor manufacturing states. The factory owners will live like in Miami, or Vegas or LA or whatever. 

Prices will go up, he has already fired federal workers, and destroyed protections, and worker rights, and environmental protections, etc...
Companies will have to tighten their belts, and restructure. Many people will be laid off, and jobless. He's driving the country into another great depression.

If Americans get poor enough that they will work for wages as competitively low as in China or Vietnam or whatever, then it will make sense to build the factories there. 

The money will be easy to find. The government can subsidize. The tariffs will help make people poor and it will help imports be more expensive.

The major problem with this is that if Americans figure this out, they'll be very pissed and revolt, and other nations especially with Trump making threats of annexation, and being so aggressive and confrontational, they won't want to import American products on principle.

But Trump will blame Canadians, and Mexicans, and whoever else he wants to invade, and then go to war and try and essentially force these countries to buy his goods. Idk if MAGA will fall for that, but most likely I'd guess they will.

I just don't see how any of this could play out in a positive way. 

Best case scenario I can see, is American citizens revolt, states refuse to play ball with the federal government, civil war breaks out, Canada and the free world combine with these freedom states to depose Trump, who, most likely rigged the election in his favour anyway. 

I mean, he has said it was easy to do, he alluded to fixing things up so nobody will have to vote for him again, and that he had some secret plans to win.

Trump doesn't want america to be rich. He wants Trump to be rich. He has no issues making all of you dirt poor so he can exploit you, send you to war, make you live as slaves in his factories, so that he can have a bigger palace, a bigger yacht, and a nicer golf course.",9,1744162634.0,2

While the collapse was happening Wednesday night, I was looking for commentary from economists from around the world. I found major chinese hedge fund managers and economists streaming on douyin (their tiktok) and bilibili (their youtube) that normally only upload completed (edited) shorts and vids.

They were smirking and said 'even on its way out, the Americans are teaching us about stuff we have never seen before' and when one of the chatters raised the question about the 800 billion or so US bond holding that China had and what would happen if the US economy blew up? This is what he said:

""How much do you think China would be willing to pay for the US just to go away? How would you 'price' the cost of being able to do business without sanctions and bullying from the US? How fast do you think we can earn that back in a world free of empire, trading with Europe, South America and the rest of Asia? The CPC was ready to pay for liberation of the world if it meant war, an 800 billion bill to get rid of an empire, self imploded empire no less, is a deal they would take immediately. They are not worried about their holdings.""

Not sure about the rest of the countries that may or may not have a grudge against USA, but that scared me a little.

EDIT:

Okay I didn't expect this comment to blow up, but here is a few things that needs to be clarified for those of you who read the comment and started thinking like an American:

* These guys are not 'grand standing' to scare the Americans in some sort of imaginary PR war, because:
   * this was streaming on the day as it was happening, it was not a scheduled program,
   * you need to use bilibili or have the Chinese version of tiktok that they use in China, 
   * you need to be searching for live broadcasts about economics on a platform that is 75% cats, food, and/or girls dancing;
   * it was like 2 or 3 AM in the morning;
   * there was no script or editing, it was just a bunch of 30-50 year olds talking and watching a number go up (the yield rate);
   * the whole thing was broadcasted in MANDARIN CHINESE, and last time I checked Americans spoke AMERICAN.

1jx8y54,mmorl0r,t1_mmonme0,emjaycue,"Reposting this ELI5 I posted elsewhere earlier today.  Hope you find it helpful. 

Imagine the U.S. government borrows money from people for 10 years and promises to pay them back with a bit of extra money (interest). That “bit of extra” is called the yield. A Treasury is basically that. It’s an instrument where the government borrows money and agrees to pay back more after a period of time. So the 10-year Treasury is a loan the government will pay back in 10 years with a little extra.

Now let’s say I buy a Treasury for $10 and get $11 back from the government over 10 years. That’s a 10% return over its life, or about 0.96% annually if compounded, but roughly 1%/year if simplified. We call that a 1% yield.

Why does dumping bonds make the price go down? Simple supply and demand — just like selling stocks makes their prices go down. If you suddenly sell a lot of anything, the price drops because supply overwhelms demand. Now, China has almost $800 billion in Treasuries (and they are also a big buyer, which creates demand). Japan holds even more — about $1 trillion. That can move markets.

And remember, even if China holds only a small fraction of total outstanding Treasuries, what matters is the float — that is, how much is being bought and sold at a given time. For example, say typically 1% of the houses in your city are on sale at any time. Now some real estate mogul decides to sell all his houses, which make up 2% of the housing stock. That’s a small fraction of all the homes in the city — but it triples the supply that’s for sale. There aren’t enough buyers for that. So prices drop. A lot.

Even though it’s just a 2% change in total inventory, it’s a huge disruption to the normal market activity. Japan and China can flush the Treasury market in a similar way. If they sell a lot at once, there simply won’t be enough buyers ready with cash — and that’s what we call a liquidity crunch or low-liquidity situation.  Since China is a big Treasury buyer, they can affect the demand side too by stopping their buying.

Remember that bond that paid $11 that I bought for $10??  Now let’s say I sell that bond for $8 because someone is dumping bonds and prices are falling. That bond still pays $11 over its life. So the person who buys it from me is getting a $3 gain on an $8 investment — or a 37.5% total return over 10 years. That translates into about 3.2% annually (compounded) — a big jump from the original 1% yield!

So as you can see, as bond prices go down, yields go up — they move inversely. Now, the next time the government wants to borrow money, it can’t offer the old 1% yield anymore. Why? Because people can just go buy that 3.2% yielding bond on the open market. To compete, the government has to raise the interest rate on new bonds to match what the market is demanding. So it ends up paying more to borrow money.

Why Is This Important?

Because the 10-year Treasury yield is a benchmark — many other loans (like mortgages, car loans, student loans, and business loans) key off of it.

So when the yield goes up, it means the U.S. government has to pay more to borrow — and so do you.

Higher yields = higher interest rates across the board.

That’s bad for:

• Homebuyers – higher mortgage rates = higher monthly payments

• Businesses – higher borrowing costs = harder to invest, hire, or expand

• The government – more of the federal budget goes toward interest payments instead of programs like schools or infrastructure

• The stock market – investors shift money out of stocks and into safe, high-yielding bonds, pushing stock prices down

Basically, because so many interest rates are tied to the 10-year Treasury yield, any increase in that yield raises the cost of capital for the entire economy. Getting money becomes more expensive. Business slows down. At the same time, stock prices drop.

It’s a double whammy.

That’s why people watch the health of the Treasury market so closely — because it affects nearly everything in the economy, even if you don’t own a single bond yourself.

And China wouldn’t even need to crash the market — just sell slowly and steadily, nudging the long end of the yield curve upward over time. Exactly what we are seeing now.  That alone can quietly erode the U.S. economy. Think boiling frog.

The Chinese can then take the capital freed up from those Treasury sales and invest it back into their own domestic economy — infrastructure, industrial policy, innovation — effectively blunting the impact of a trade war. So they’re hitting the brakes on us while stepping on the gas at home.

China is smart enough to know this, and they have the tools to do it.

The dollar’s status as the global reserve currency gives the U.S. immense advantages. But there’s no such thing as a free lunch — and this kind of yield exposure is the price we pay for that privilege. As they say, “With great power comes great responsibility.”

When the U.S. is strong, stable, and globally engaged, the financial pool is too deep for even China to make a splash. But if we start pulling back from the global economy, undermining our own institutions, and projecting unreliability? That’s when the macroeconomic knives can come out and actually hurt us.  A lot.

Diseases were eradicated, entire nations lifted from poverty and into technological brilliance, a massive increase in the speed and scale of technological innovation, billions of humans given a real chance at a truly decent life with more rights than our ancestors could have ever imagined, and so much more.

But a few greedy fools have decided that they would rather burn all that down so they can rule over the pile of ashes. And a few million fools here voted for it.

The point of tariffs IS to raise prices. That is how they work. Using tariffs properly means picking a very specific industry, putting up a tariff and then potentially subsidizing the industry to some degree at home. This means the people in that industry at home can offer the product at a lower price, while those outside of the country can never keep up with that price because of the tariffs. And so you can grow a domestic industry, even if it would otherwise not be viable.

Tariffs are mostly a tool for developing countries, or something for key strategic industries, such as microchips.

They are also very risky because, for example, they can cause trade wars and retaliation and all other sorts of instability. And that's when they're used well.

Tariffs across the board make no sense. There just aren't enough people in the United States working at a low enough price to produce ALL of the things that Americans normally import. This means a drop in supply and higher prices. Potentially higher costs for American corporations too since the things they have to import to make their own products now cost more.

Trump doesn't understand anything about the economy. He's a complete moron.

Best everyone can hope for is that he doesn't actually end up doing it, or does a significantly lesser more targetted version of it. But as you, in this post, demonstrate the threat of it is damaging in itself.",443,1731095829.0,0

Why?

Because a core tenant of the Federal Reserves dual mandate is low inflation and high employment.

Last week, or the week before, the house of representatives financial services committee stood up a ""task force"" to ""determine if the Fed is effective in their role"". In the opening remarks, the chair (republican) laid into Fed policy stating they weren't meeting their obligations. The ranking Democrat gave a scathing rebuke standing for Fed independence and the sham investigation Republicans kicked off.

My prediction:

1. Economy continues to spiral
2. Fed refuses to reduce rates as inflation creeps back up
3. White House says the Fed isn't protecting the economy
4. White House says their data says the Fed is wrong
5. Treasury secretary says the Fed is wrong
6. Trump pushes for a no-confidendence on the Fed to remove independence
7. Congress attempts to repeal dodd frank and amend the Fed Reserve act of 1913

Well here’s the thing, that’s not how markets work in real life. Doubtful that a made in America company will sell their product for less since they don’t have to pay tariffs. They are gonna look at their competitors and say look these guys raised their prices so I can get that much money for the same thing. Doubtful that he will give up profit just to undercut businesses that outsourced their labor to chi/mex/ca.

Ever thought about how the product are cheaper in those countries? Maybe it’s because the their countries subsidize things like healthcare and food. companies don’t have to pay higher wages because the government helps the working class.


Edit:
The arguments I’ve seen in the comments show a huge misunderstanding about tariffs. Trump voters blindly defend them without fully grasping their broader economic implications. Many claim that Chinese labor is primarily forced or akin to slavery, which is an oversimplification. While labor abuses exist in some cases, the reality is far more complex. They mostly say that American-made goods will eventually become cheaper as tariffs supposedly incentivize companies to move production back to the us. This is deeply flawed logic, especially considering the temporary nature of presidency. Since we already know that Trump is only in office for 4 years, businesses have little incentive to overhaul their supply chains for what may be a short-lived policy.

Others have criticized me for allegedly portraying foreign governments as “benevolent.” That was never my argument. My point is that labor costs in countries like Mexico, Canada, and China are lower partly due to externalities, or government policies that reduce living expenses. Universal healthcare, for example, is a major cost offset. When workers don’t have to rely on employer-provided healthcare, companies can afford to pay lower wages without sacrificing quality of life. These kinds of subsidies and policies fundamentally lower the cost of production—a nuance lost in overly simplistic defenses of tariffs.

Many have acknowledged the inevitable ripple effects of tariffs on the market. Even if a product is “Made in America,” its components, materials, and transportation costs are all tied to global markets, all of which will be impacted by tariffs. As a business owner, I can confirm that added costs (whether from tariffs or other factors) are almost always passed on to customers. In fact, some businesses might exploit the confusion around tariffs to justify price increases, even on products unaffected by tariffs by blaming the policy.

Historically, flat tariffs have not led to long-term economic growth in the us. some strategic tariffs after ww2 helped stabilize the global economy, these were highly targeted and part of a broader recovery plan. Flat tariffs, are blunt tools that are inherently inflationary, distort markets and ineffective. If you don’t believe me ask AI or read any credible economic analysis.",497,1732969419.0,0

There are many reasons why countries export goods in abundance to other counties. We can produce things we import but maybe not as cheaply or in sufficient amount. Very simply put, let's look at coffee. Hawaii produces coffee, as do Puerto Rico, and California. They are not able to produce it in the quantities desired; consumption of coffee in the US was about 3.26 billion pounds in 2023 according to USA Facts. Hawaii is our largest domestic producer and they produced 11.5 million pounds that same year. 

So... how do we satisfy the much larger demand that domestic supply? By importing. The same goes for other countries. The largest exports by the US in 2023 were mineral oils, and mineral fuels; think petroleum, refined, crude, and gas, and integrated circuits, ie. chips. 

There are a number of reasons why some countries can produce certain items less expensively and in greater quantity, often relating to resources ie. mineral deposits, or growing conditions. Again let's use produce in this case bananas. Most of the US is too cold. Only the southernmost areas such as, again, Hawaii, or Florida are capable of commercial production. In 2009 the US produced 0.01% of the world production of bananas. We aren't capable of supplying our own country. Now let's look at minerals. The US does not have deposits of bismuth, graphite, gallium, and manganese to name just a few. Therefore, how can we obtain these minerals which are used in alloys, batteries, semiconductors, and LED? By importing. 

We're only shooting ourselves in the foot, imo, with tariffs. Sure, we can encourage domestic production and use, but there are simply some areas in which global trade is necessary, in both directions. Others could do the same to US exports, potentially curtailing our export of certain goods. 
Do keep in mind, that goods which are not as efficiently produced here, will cost more to produce and therefore consume. So don't expect your Kona Coffee to cost the same as your Great Value coffee sourced in Colombia and Brazil.

Tariffs are to protect manufacturing that ALREADY exists. They also, in different ways, are used to protect national security interests.

With tariffs that are too strong across the board then all prices go up and the consumer loses. Inflation. That’s the case with trumps description. If the tariffs are too high then the domestic market rises to meet demand and to not leave easy profit on the table. If a foreign toothbrush is suddenly $20 the domestic won’t remain $5. Greed runs economy.

Tariffs are never to function as weapons, punishment, or in a blanket manner. They also aren’t meant to be disproportionately large. All these uses cause trade wars. Trade wars are quite literally always bad. Trade is meant to be win win.

What if I told you a particular tariff policy-

1- lost more domestic jobs than it gained

2- lowered overall GDP of the US

3- raised domestic prices of items we don’t manufacture domestically

4- ended up causing such issues that you need to allocate billions, 92% of the tariff revenue, to bailout sectors injured in your trade war

Rather than letting the most meager of social policies give Americans reprieve, they've decided to end this whole ""Republic"" experiment early and move on to fascism.

In previous depression periods, the capitalists were not rich enough to seize the pillars of the economy. This time they are well prepared. Just like the industrial giants of Nazi Germany were able to seize the crumbling pillars of the Weimar Republic.

Now, let's be clear. This is ALWAYS the end-stage of capitalism. There is no alternative, all countries can do is slow down this regression with collective action and labour rights.

The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 is widely regarded as a significant factor that exacerbated the Great Depression. Here's how:   

Reduction of International Trade:
The act raised tariffs on thousands of imported goods, making them significantly more expensive.   
This prompted retaliatory tariffs from other countries, leading to a dramatic decline in international trade.   
The reduction in trade meant a decrease in exports and imports, which negatively impacted businesses and economies worldwide.   
Worsening Economic Conditions:
The decline in exports hurt American industries, particularly agriculture, which relied heavily on overseas markets.   
This led to further job losses and economic hardship.
The global nature of the retaliatory tariffs meant that the economic downturn was amplified across nations.   
Contributing to Global Economic Contraction:
By hindering international trade, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act contributed to a global economic contraction, deepening the Great Depression.   
It fostered a ""beggar-thy-neighbor"" policy, where countries tried to protect their own economies at the expense of others, which ultimately harmed everyone.   
In essence, the tariffs created a cycle of protectionism that strangled international trade, worsened economic conditions, and prolonged the Great Depression",37,1743665842.0,1

People rarely have one, single motivation in life, so I think it's probably a combination of all these things. He also can't ever admit he's wrong; he both wants to punish America but he also wants to be admired for making America stronger. But he's way too dumb to understand how to do that. 

You guys know how he came up with this tariff idea? During his first term, he had no economic policy, so he asked Jared Kushner to think of one after giving Jared some brief ideas of what he wanted to see. Jared went on Amazon and just started scrolling through books until he found a title he really liked; ""Death by China"" by Peter Navarro. It advocated the weaponization of tariffs against everyone. Navarro is a self-described ""deficit hawk"" who spends the whole book quoting from an ""Economic expert"" named Ron Vara. It was later discovered that this expert does not exist, and is just an anagram of Navarro's last name. That didn't stop Navarro from being hired after Jared found his book. Navarro would even write memos for Trump's staff under the name of his fake source in order to give himself more credibility. This is literally the sole basis for the tariffs. Once Trump even gets a whiff of an idea he likes, he cannot let go no matter what. And he's way too stupid to understand even minor complexities.

1jtlcb2,mluzn5p,t3_1jtlcb2,GrumpyFinn,"Russia sees some benefit from the tariffs that President Donald Trump imposed on almost all countries except it.


Economist Aleksei Zubets estimated in Russian media that one of the most important benefits for Russia is that Western countries will ""forget"" about Ukraine while focusing on the trade war started by the United States.


According to Zubets, the war in Ukraine ceased to be the center of attention last Wednesday, when Trump announced new tariffs on almost all countries.


For example, the United States imposed a 20 percent import tariff on the European Union.


""Everyone is interested in US tariffs and their consequences for Europe, Asia and the whole world. Ukraine is no longer of interest to anyone, and that's good,"" Zubets commented to Gazeta.ru .


Only Russia, Belarus, North Korea and Cuba were exempt from US tariffs, the first three of which are involved in the war of aggression in Ukraine.


The United States has already imposed several sanctions on Russia, which has restricted Russian trade with the United States.


According to Russian media reports , trade between the United States and Russia was $3.5 billion last year, the lowest figure since 1992.


The corresponding figure before Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2021 was $35 billion.


Oleg Savchenko , deputy chairman of the State Duma's Financial Markets Committee and Duma representative, is gloating over the tariffs imposed by Trump.


He said Russia knows what awaits countries that are subject to tariffs.


""Russia has experienced all these difficulties because of sanctions. We are ready for any challenges, so we can sit with popcorn and watch how this ends,"" Savchenko told Gazeta.ru.


However, Savchenko does not believe that the Russian economy will benefit in any way from avoiding tariffs.


Russian experts have different views on whether the Russian economy benefits from avoiding customs duties or not.


Russia, isolated by various sanctions, is not completely disconnected from the global economy, so Trump's tariffs will ultimately affect it as well.


Investment analyst Aleksandr Razuyev considers Russia's exclusion from tariffs above all as a sign of friendship.


“It is kind to both our country and personally to President Vladimir Putin .”


He has written a comment on the impact of Trump's tariffs on Russia on the Finam.ru market website.


Razujev writes that customs duties raise the prices of all goods in the world, which also makes illegal imports to Russia more expensive.


He believes that Trump's tariffs will also have a negative impact on the Russian economy, even though it avoided tariffs, unlike 185 other countries.


Razuyev predicts that the trade war will lead to a global recession and lower oil prices, which will be detrimental to the Russian economy.


However, he looks ahead.


“We are living in very interesting times. I believe that our country will play all its trump cards and become a great superpower. And Trump will help with that, but it will not happen until all the dead and wounded as a result of his policies are removed.”


Economist Mikhail Belyaev, in turn, estimated for the Regnum news website that US tariffs are forcing European countries to turn towards Russia.


The Chinese market is so competitive that, according to Belyaev, Europeans will not survive unless they reorient their trade to the East.",196,1744032810.0,0

People frequently talk about the failure of the US education system to teach civics and basic accounting/finance. But I very often find out that smart college graduates from families that value education don't understand the history and importance of the US dollar as the global reserve currency. Separate from accounting and finance, why is this not a critical component of US history curriculum?

The pithiest modern explanation I have for why people should know this is that it totally answers and rebukes Trump's obsession with trade deficits. It doesn't matter that the US buys more from China than China buys from the US, because nearly every transaction China has with any other country happens using US dollars. Not directly of course, but the net effect is that *our* financial intuitions and *our* banks get a cut of *every* multinational transaction out there. This more than offsets whatever trade deficit might exist, and it ensures that *your* bank accounts and *your* retirement savings are the best they can be. Globally, we have the cheapest borrowing costs and the highest interest earnings on deposits (once you adjust for currency). The value of this to us cannot be understated, and Trump is on a direct path to fuck it all up.

I really urge everyone that will listen to least read the Wikipedia article on the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944. People need to understand how fucking lucky we were to win that negotiation, and how there is no way in hell we would win a similar negotiation today.

1j8ron3,mh7rwv6,t3_1j8ron3,AmericanScream,"If anybody is wondering why Trump would engage in such absurd ""negotiation"" tactics, it can be traced to his history and pathology.  Here's a professor whose specialty is negotiations discussing in-a-nutshell why Trump's tactics are incredibly foolish:

----

“I’m going to get a little wonky and write about Donald Trump and negotiations. For those who don't know, I'm an adjunct professor at Indiana University - Robert H. McKinney School of Law and I teach negotiations. Okay, here goes.

Trump, as most of us know, is the credited author of ""The Art of the Deal,"" a book that was actually ghost written by a man named Tony Schwartz, who was given access to Trump and wrote based upon his observations. If you've read The Art of the Deal, or if you've followed Trump lately, you'll know, even if you didn't know the label, that he sees all dealmaking as what we call ""distributive bargaining.""

Distributive bargaining always has a winner and a loser. It happens when there is a fixed quantity of something and two sides are fighting over how it gets distributed. Think of it as a pie and you're fighting over who gets how many pieces. In Trump's world, the bargaining was for a building, or for construction work, or subcontractors. He perceives a successful bargain as one in which there is a winner and a loser, so if he pays less than the seller wants, he wins. The more he saves the more he wins.

The other type of bargaining is called integrative bargaining. In integrative bargaining the two sides don't have a complete conflict of interest, and it is possible to reach mutually beneficial agreements. Think of it, not a single pie to be divided by two hungry people, but as a baker and a caterer negotiating over how many pies will be baked at what prices, and the nature of their ongoing relationship after this one gig is over.

The problem with Trump is that he sees only distributive bargaining in an international world that requires integrative bargaining. He can raise tariffs, but so can other countries. He can't demand they not respond. There is no defined end to the negotiation and there is no simple winner and loser. There are always more pies to be baked. Further, negotiations aren't binary. China's choices aren't (a) buy soybeans from US farmers, or (b) don't buy soybeans. They can also (c) buy soybeans from Russia, or Argentina, or Brazil, or Canada, etc. That completely strips the distributive bargainer of his power to win or lose, to control the negotiation.

One of the risks of distributive bargaining is bad will. In a one-time distributive bargain, e.g. negotiating with the cabinet maker in your casino about whether you're going to pay his whole bill or demand a discount, you don't have to worry about your ongoing credibility or the next deal. If you do that to the cabinet maker, you can bet he won't agree to do the cabinets in your next casino, and you're going to have to find another cabinet maker.

There isn't another Canada.

So when you approach international negotiation, in a world as complex as ours, with integrated economies and multiple buyers and sellers, you simply must approach them through integrative bargaining. If you attempt distributive bargaining, success is impossible. And we see that already.

Trump has raised tariffs on China. China responded, in addition to raising tariffs on US goods, by dropping all its soybean orders from the US and buying them from Russia. The effect is not only to cause tremendous harm to US farmers, but also to increase Russian revenue, making Russia less susceptible to sanctions and boycotts, increasing its economic and political power in the world, and reducing ours. Trump saw steel and aluminum and thought it would be an easy win, BECAUSE HE SAW ONLY STEEL AND ALUMINUM - HE SEES EVERY NEGOTIATION AS DISTRIBUTIVE. China saw it as integrative, and integrated Russia and its soybean purchase orders into a far more complex negotiation ecosystem.

Trump has the same weakness politically. For every winner there must be a loser. And that's just not how politics works, not over the long run.

For people who study negotiations, this is incredibly basic stuff, negotiations 101, definitions you learn before you even start talking about styles and tactics. And here's another huge problem for us.

Trump is utterly convinced that his experience in a closely held real estate company has prepared him to run a nation, and therefore he rejects the advice of people who spent entire careers studying the nuances of international negotiations and diplomacy. But the leaders on the other side of the table have not eschewed expertise, they have embraced it. And that means they look at Trump and, given his very limited tool chest and his blindly distributive understanding of negotiation, they know exactly what he is going to do and exactly how to respond to it.

From a professional negotiation point of view, Trump isn't even bringing checkers to a chess match. He's bringing a quarter that he insists of flipping for heads or tails, while everybody else is studying the chess board to decide whether its better to open with Najdorf or Grünfeld.”

Now of course your mom and pop shop has neither the market power nor  the international reach, so they'll be stuck buying the most expensive stuff and likely paying the full tariff.

Trump is completely wrecking the country from the ground up. Unrecoverable. All for a quick buck for his puppet-masters.

Editing to add because some people seem confused:

Here's what I do for work. I design vehicles that use various types of metals, plastics and tech. Part of designing is knowing the materials - composition, availability, import/export, etc. 

We import 97% of the manganese ore we use. About 70% of that goes straight to our steel industry. While we can produce tiny amounts of manganese in the US, it's not economically viable and cannot compete with Gabon or South Africa's production. So if Trump breaks trade relations with those countries or their allies, we could suddenly find our entire steel industry shut down. We are the THIRD largest steel producer in the world. Our economy depends on our steel industry. 

But that's not even the tip of what Trump is doing. Because there are dozens of other critical minerals and materials that we rely on importing to keep various industries afloat. You know China provides almost 100% of our gallium? That's where we get it all to keep our electronic, solar panel and electric car industries supplied. If we get cut off, there goes all those industries. 

Canada provides 80% of our potash through imports. No potash means no farming. 

Want a fun google trip? Google **""critical minerals in the US""** and see where we import these necessary things from. Canada is on there. China. Australia. All the countries Trump is using violent measures instead of diplomacy with. And more.

He stood out among other Republican politicians for his willingness to be openly and blatantly racist. That's why so many Americans love him so much.

There's something very bad in the water in this country because everyone continuously assumes everything we've built our country on is a sham house of cards that's about to tip over. The reality is that this crisis was manufactured by a moron who was elected by a bunch of people that were personally doing ok, but were absolutely insistent everything was about to fall to pieces in the exact same way you are right now. The US, absent Trump, would have continued to be an unequal, politically dysfunctional, but extremely successful and productive country. There is no reason we can't still be that even with all the damage Trump is doing. He's not going to be in office forever and if he fucks up enough, he absolutely will lose his grip on power. Here's the reality check:

>The Fed is cornered—rates are high, inflation refuses to die, and there's no bailout coming this time. The only soft landing is for the billionaires with parachutes made of your 401(k).

This is the most legitimate part of this post. Tariffs can absolutely cause stagflation and the country is not positioned to give a big bailout right now, deficit-wise. There's a big lesson here about watching deficits and not assuming that interest rates will be low forever, but the Fed still has some ammo and we're seeing some signs of congressional Republicans cracking. If shit gets bad they will absolutely leave Trump for dead to try to save their asses in 2026 in the same way that they lined up to kiss his ass when it benefited them.

>Tech is imploding under the weight of hype and weak fundamentals.

Meta, Google, Microsft, Amazon, and Apple all have rock-solid high margin business models with no competitors besides each other. Maybe they trade at a P/E of 20 or 15 or even 10 instead of 30, but they dominate innovative, high-margin, and still growing businesses.

>AI was a sugar high. Now we’re crashing.

AI is a real technology that will cause actual productivity increases. Productivity increases due to new technologies is the reason everything always goes up and AI is showing us there are more gains to come.

>Banks are getting shaky. 

Not really. FDIC, Fed and 2008 said that even if they looked shaky, which they don't really, they'd be bailed out and backstopped.

>Commercial real estate is a time bomb. And consumers? They're maxed out, broke, and paying 29% on credit cards to buy gas and eggs.

This isn't 2008. Real estate isn't hyper-inflated; there's not enough of it in the places people want to live and work and it's pricing people out.

>And just when we needed stability, we get chaos: Trump’s back in the mix with unhinged tariffs, trade wars 2.0, and economic policies that look like they were scribbled on a napkin in a Denny’s at 3 a.m. Markets hate uncertainty—guess what? That’s all we’ve got now.

Yup and the result is a bunch of bright-red days. This policy is so colossally stupid and unnecessary. But this is a manufactured recession.

If you accidentally say something true when you're trying to lie, you have failed, but if you say something true when you're bullshitting, that's no problem at all.)

""In our day these economic truths have become accepted as self-evident. We have accepted, so to speak, a second Bill of Rights under which a new basis of security and prosperity can be established for all—regardless of station, race, or creed.

Among these are:

- The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation;

- The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation;

- The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living;

- The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad;

- The right of every family to a decent home;

- The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health;

- The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment;

- The right to a good education.

All of these rights spell security. And after this war is won we must be prepared to move forward, in the implementation of these rights, to new goals of human happiness and well-being.

America's own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for all our citizens. For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world.""",458,1743693739.0,1

That way, Country A can specialize in X, allowing both countries to benefit through trade.

This is something some conservatives still don’t seem to understand. The U.S. has always been a pioneer in the tech and service industries, which is why countries like China focused on manufacturing. Both were able to grow because of this specialization.

Most of the debate around Trump’s tariffs focuses on traditional economic questions…how they’ll impact markets, consumers, or trade partners. Even this post is a distraction. But this isn’t just about economics or use of AI. It’s about restructuring how power works in America.

Trump has repeatedly expressed a desire to abolish the IRS and eliminate the income tax. That would require either a repeal or rewrite of Title 26 of the U.S. Code or repeal the 16th Amendment…a nearly impossible task. But he doesn’t need to repeal it if he can defund and disable the system it created.

And that seems to be the strategy.

The IRS is already weakened. Through appointments, budget constraints, and policy manipulation, it can be further gutted…making it harder for Congress to fund federal programs. If income tax enforcement collapses, Congress’s control over fiscal policy erodes.

At the same time, Trump is pushing tariffs…“external revenue” collected by Customs and Border Protection under DHS. While Congress officially sets tariffs, presidents now wield considerable authority under national security pretexts. If CBP becomes a revenue arm of the executive, and Congress fails to respond, this becomes a quiet shift of fiscal power to the presidency.  Just watch when Trump announces the creation of the “External Revenue Service” in the coming days. 

Legally, the Constitution remains. Functionally, its balance of power tilts.  A lot. 

With both chambers of Congress under Republican control, opposition is unlikely. Checks and balances don’t work without political will. And this moment is revealing just how conditional that will can be.

But that still doesn’t answer the deeper question…Why is this happening now?

Demographic trends show steady growth in ethnic minority populations…many of whom have historically leaned Democratic. That creates a long-term challenge for conservatives and the Republican Party, which has relied more on white, rural, and religious voters.

For some factions within that coalition…particularly Christian nationalists and others motivated by single-issue politics around abortion, gun rights, religious freedom, or LGBTQ+ issues…this demographic shift toward minorities (I.e. liberals) is seen as an existential threat. In some cases, it’s tied to openly racist/supremacist or nativist ideologies.

That’s why simultaneously immigration becomes such a hot button topic …it’s not a coincidence. Republicans understand it accelerates the demographic trend. That’s why voter suppression and gerrymandering are equally forced…they’re tools to resist that shift.

And that’s why a strong executive isn’t feared…it’s embraced. Because in the face of a long-term political disadvantage, concentrated power becomes a survival strategy. A necessary chess move to retain influence and control. 

If we keep watching only the market reaction, we’ll miss the real transformation happening right in front of us.",555,1743711440.0,0

The theory was first floated by Destiny, a popular political commentator. He accused the administration of using ChatGPT to calculate the tariffs the U.S. is charged by other countries, ""which is why the tariffs make absolutely no fucking sense.""

""They're simply dividing the trade deficit we have with a country with our imports from that country, or using 10%, whichever is greater,"" Destiny, who goes by @TheOmniLiberal on X, shared in a post on Wednesday.

He attached a screenshot of his exchange with the AI bot. He started by asking ChatGPT, ""What would be an easy way to calculate the tariffs that should be imposed on other countries so that the US is on even-playing fields when it comes to trade deficit? Set minimum at 10%.""

""To calculate tariffs that help level the playing field in terms of trade deficits (with a minimum tariff of 10%), you can use a proportional tariff formula based on the trade deficit with each country.

1k5yk4w,mom2m9w,t1_molt7re,teachersecret,"Also the lack of farm labor and cost of farm inputs are looking ugly.

I live in rural America. Out here, the farms and ranches rely on Hispanic labor for a massive amount of the actual work that gets done to bring food to American tables. It’s not a “they’re cheaper” situation - it’s a “the labor doesn’t exist if they’re not here” situation. These rural areas are dying, elderly, and incapable of raising a proper workforce without them.

We’re deliberately deporting and terrifying those people. Shackling people’s hands and feet and throwing random immigrants with no criminal conviction into El Salvador’s gang torture death prison is a good way to ensure your farm labor force doesn’t show their faces in public.

The imports are an issue, but domestic production isn’t looking good either. It’s the season for putting that future food in the ground and the cost of doing so this year is going to be substantially different than normal. The effects of this will take awhile to show up (things have to be grown, fertilized, taken care of, harvested, transported, processed, transported, shelved), but I can tell you right now that there isn’t a single part of that entire chain that isn’t going to feel it from the bottom up.

And that doesn’t just affect America. America is the world’s largest food exporter. Yes, we import massive amounts too (a slight surplus recently - and we can’t grow a mango very well in Texas) but the foods we -export- (like corn) are core staple foods that important for the nutrition of billions of people globally. In terms of raw calories, we export significantly more calories than we import. We help feed the planet… or we used to.

People will die because of this. USAID’s overnight shuttering alone is already starting to kill people in the most destitute parts of the world. The double whammy of increased costs on the food that does show up is going to hurt. Death toll will be in the millions when we’re done and looking back (the death toll just from USAID going away will be that high, let alone any of this other nonsense).

	•	Deploy the military domestically – that power is governed by the Insurrection Act, not IEEPA.

	•	Suspend labor laws – there’s no provision in IEEPA allowing this.

	•	Expand warrantless searches – IEEPA doesn’t override Fourth Amendment protections or judicial oversight.

	•	Control domestic media or social platforms – the Berman Amendment to IEEPA protects informational materials and personal communications, including social media and broadcasts.

	•	What IEEPA does allow:

	•	Freeze or block foreign assets and restrict economic transactions with entities tied to foreign threats.

Now, California seeks to do just that. Faced with sweeping tariffs that threaten the livelihood of its farmers and manufacturers, the state is exploring ways to shield its economy. But if the federal government refuses to allow it, or worse, actively blocks those efforts, then we are left with a troubling inconsistency.

He said he'd build a wall and make Mexico pay for it.    

He said he'd establish a ban on Muslims entering the U.S.     

He said he'd put out his own medical paln to replace the ACA.     

He said he would impose the death penalty for cop killers.       

He said he would place lifetime bans on White House officials lobbying for foreign government.       

He said he would place lifetime bans on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.

He said he would make 6-week paid leave mandatory.     

He said he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton.     

He said he would get Congress to allow health insurance across state lines.    

He said he would eliminate Common Core.      

He said he would stop the AT&T Time Warner Merger.       

He said he would allow individuals to deduct health care insurance premiums from taxes.      

He said he would enact congressional term limits.      

He said he would have mandatory minimum sentences for criminals caught trying to re-enter the United States illegally.        

He said he would eliminate gun-free zones at schools and military bases.        

He said he would expand national right to carry to all 50 states        


He said he would open up libel laws.

The feds will go back to paying these people, just with much, much fewer benefits; such as pensions, PTO, decent healthcare, labor protections, and other perks.

They'll blame the democrats for the initial layoffs due to their ""decades of bloated, liberal spending"" or whatever bs they conjure, but then will take credit for the 10-15 million new private sector jobs the conservatives created via these contractors.  Some of these laid-off workers will take an early retirement, but the remainder who do not find jobs will just be ignored on whichever slanted, misleading, TikTok or Fox News infographic du jour they shove in our faces.

Shareholders and the ownership class will reap the benefits, while the decrease in the federal budget will be negligible, due to middle-men taking their cuts.

All current conservative policies terminate at the same two endpoints: 1) further enriching shareholders and the already wealthy, or 2) punishing the lazy or immoral. Since they unironically see government workers as indolent and malevolent, they'll get both.

He's always leaned more right wing. He grew up in a Catholic household, became a Christian and that's a big part of his identity. But he's also been more of a ""I think everyone in government is full of shit"" type of guy. He's always bucked with authority and had a general distrust of politicians. This is a guy who nearly got kicked out of the Army in Vietnam for drug trouble and not listening to his commanders.

I figured *for sure* he would dislike Trump, figured he wouldn't much care for Harris, and assumed he would just be in the ""Eh, why bother?"" camp. But he said he was ""scared"" of Kamala Harris, and thought she was going to be bad for the US in the future. 

The day before the election, he called again, and just kept saying ""I don't know, it's your future"" when I'd affirmed I was voting Harris, and I just had to tell him ""Dad, I *am* very concerned for my future. It's why I don't want to elect someone who's openly talking, *even if it's just a joke*, about being a dictator when he takes over. Even if it's just for a day. It's why I'm concerned with someone who wants to kick out the people who just had the audacity to come to the US stupidly believing the American dream that's been withheld from plenty of American citizens from day one. It's why I was worried about a President coming in with tariffs being his big campaign issue, when he clearly didn't seem to understand exactly how they worked. There is a lot I'm concerned with, and my future in this country, and this country's future in the world is what concerns me, and it's more concerning that you're scared of a black woman than you are a lying idiot who's been making shit up from the start"". 

We didn't really get past that, but it's somehow become even more depressing than I had expected. I didn't foresee him actually threatening Canada with invasion and forcing them to become a 51st state (an idea that is stupid itself, since they have ten provinces themselves...). I wish I hadn't pretty much nailed how he would handle Ukraine, but even I couldn't have predicted that he would invite Zelenskyy to what felt like an ambush interview with that clown Vance. 

It's frustrating, because I really tried to reach both of my parents on why I understood they weren't going to become Democrats, but I figured they would at least *not support someone like Trump.* But its' tough. They're both deeply religious, and it's hard to reason someone out of those positions that they attach to their religion. Even when my Mom half-jokingly says ""What made you this way!?"" to me when we're talking politics and I have to just say ""YOU! YOU DID THIS! REMEMBER!? All of the times you took me to church and told me that it was important to care for others, to protect people who can't protect themselves, to provide for people who are struggling to provide for themselves, not because it's beneficial to you, but because it's right. All the times you took me to the library and told me to just go nuts and I'd come back with books stacked to my chin.

I already explained how the WHO works: everyone pays dues to access WHO's services, and anyone who wants extra *pays* extra--knowing that everyone else will still have access to what's being paid for.

*Maybe* you could argue that China funding particular research influences the WHO, but that'd be no different than the additional funding the USA provided until Trump's first administration (and also during Biden's administration).  It certainly isn't *controlling* the WHO.

To use the analogy I used before, this would be like US Steel paying the ASME to test a new alloy.  Anyone who has an ASME membership would have access to the results of the testing, but the only influence US Steel would have is the fact that now ASME members know there's a new option to consider for when selecting material.

before anyone claims that China will never dump treasures, you need to know what is at stake here. for Trump to issue 145% tariff is just another way of say ""i will destroy your economy"". if China is genuinely facing the possibility of economic destruction, do you think they will care about US treasuries? of course they will unleash the nuclear weapon of financial destruction.

and if other countries see China dumping treasuries, do you think they will stick their neck out to rescue the US? for the record, when France started dumping the US dollar in 1970, other countries immediately followed, because the last guy to dump will end up holding worthless pieces of green paper. and that was exactly what happened in the 1970's.

1. **The Backwalk** — Go to maximum in the beginning of the sentence, then step it back. E.g.

>*These Mexicans are Rapists and Murderers and some of them, I suppose, are good people*

2. **The Statistics Escalator** — Always offer 3 numbers, getting increasingly crazy, and attribute the last one to nobody. E.g.

>*Under Biden the real unemployment rate is 8, 10, some even say as high as 15 percent*  

3. **Schrödinger's Subjunctive** — say you never said something but imply you might have, deny again, but imply you agree. E.g.

>*I never said that, I never said that, but even if I had, it would have been true. I never said that. I would have meant it. But I never said it*

So, let's combine these 3 moves into a powerful Trump combo about trade. Remember, he never said this, but if he did, it would sound a lot like this, and it would be exactly the type of thing he would say. But he never said it:

>America is getting ripped off. For too long, ripped off. And we're not going to get ripped off anymore. Our enemies rip us off, but our friends rip us off even worse. So we're going to have Tariffs. Tariffs. I love that word. Tariffs. We'll have big, beautiful tariffs. And we want trade, we want good trade with our friends, we want the best trade and the most trade, but we've gotta have tariffs too, we can't keep getting ripped off. But we'll have the best trade. And we'll have tariffs. We'll have rates at 10, 20 maybe even as high as 100%. And we're gonna shut down unfair goods from being dumped on our markets. And I never said prices would go up, I never said that, but if I would say that, I think it would be a very temporary thing and soon we'll find ourselves wealthier than ever before, but I'd never say that. I'd never say that. If I did it would be temporary. Temporary. But I'd never say that.

1gnzrj2,lwfsefv,t1_lwf5l7g,anchorwind,"and fox news was created in response to Ford Pardoning Nixon.  

I like to frequently remind people of a line.

Ford Pardoning Nixon was the beginning of the end. Prior to that you had people like Eisenhower who said things like:

""If a political party does not have its foundation in the determination to advance a cause that is right and that is moral, then it is not a political party; it is merely a conspiracy to seize power.""

""Teachers need our active support and encouragement. They are doing one of the most necessary and exacting jobs in the land. They are developing our most precious national resource: our children, our future citizens.""

and ""Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at all in any true sense. Under the clouds of war, it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron.""

The Nation tried to hold its Chief Executive (Nixon) accountable and instead it all got washed away. This was a signal that accountability is now optional. So begin a line that runs through -> Reagan -> Limbaugh -> Gingrich -> O'Reilly and Fox as a Whole -> Bush Jr. and Co. -> McConnell -> Trump.

Within that line you have a lot of supporting cast of varying degrees and success: Stone, Koch Bros, Ailes, Turning Point, Alex Jones, Musk, and a whole lot more working in front of and behind the camera.

We also can't forget about the Heritage Foundation and a good chunk of the Judiciary now.

""Mark my word, if and when these preachers get control of the [Republican] party, and they're sure trying to do so, it's going to be a terrible damn problem. Frankly, these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they can't and won't compromise. I know, I've tried to deal with them."" - Barry Goldwater

We've yet to truly (or even mostly) grab accountability back from the watergate era. A good portion of that has been non-stop blasting from the right messaging to divide and conquer. Two main messages: 1) 'They' are coming to harm you. - We know the 'In' group is White, Wealthy, Native-Born, Heterosexual, Christian, Cis-Gendered, Male. So the 'out' group is deviants from it - If you're a black queer woman? Oh boy. 2) Muddy the waters. Gaslight Obstruct Project.

before the election I was cautiously optimistic we were going to finally hold true the notion 'no one is above the law.'

Tariffs create an additional cost in the supply chain which may or may not hit the customer's price, dependent upon several factors - ie the shape and intersection of the supply and demand curves for the product (this is the core of microeconomics and pricing theory).

**Where is the product within that markets supply-demand curve?**  If the product offers significant consumer value and has little/no competition, then the price is within the space where the supplier can raise prices and the consumer will pay it.   If, on the other hand, the product is below that intersection point or there is competition in the manufacturing of that (or similar) products, then the supplier will be forced to reduce their revenues from their sales - cutting something in their supply chain/overhead/shipping/quality/etc (they have to make that choice).  Often different companies try different strategies until the market hits a new equilibrium.


**How quickly can the domestic market adjust?**  Domestic suppliers/manufacturers can react to these transit tariff costs in multiple ways.  Manufacturers can see the higher prices caused by tariffs and (since they don't experience them) can now introduce a product that can compete with the foreign product at a lower price.  **This is ultimately the goal of tariffs**.

In the end, tariffs are generally a net loss for the global economy, but it's important to understand the geopolitical consequences of tariffs.  Western food tariffs (which are high), for example, particularly combined with farm subsidies, keep domestic food prices low while also ensuring crop failures (which do happen) and transportation disruptions do not cause food shortages in the West (this is a good thing we all now take for granted). 

Tariffs on microchips can encourage domestic production, preventing supply chain chaos as we saw during COVID, and also ensure the national security can rely on a supply of chips during a crisis. 

...but in the modern case, tariffs are being imposed on China due to a burgeoning political/military rivalry.  Both sides of the political spectrum in the West have consolidated on the position that China has used its economic prosperity, driven by Western manufacturing, to bolster their military.  Taiwan is under threat of invasion and the South China seas are being militarized by China at an alarming rate.

As such, Biden kept the Trump trade tariffs (which Biden likely also would have enacted), and my guess is that both Harris and Trump will raise them again regardless of who wins this election.  It's a way of handicapping an emerging foreign rival.

**tldr** Tariffs are going to increase no matter what because China is building nukes and threatening to invade Taiwan.",184,1726665567.0,2

If we could already manufacture something domestically for cheaper than it can be manufactured in Bangladesh, we would be doing that. The idea of domestic manufacturers producing a cheaper product is relative to the tariff inflated prices of foreign products. 

Also, the microchip example is a complex one, since we literally cannot make high end chips in the US any time soon. Intel is going through an economic disaster as they try to develop on shore manufacturing and they aren’t even trying to develop a facility for cutting edge, current generation chips. The timeline to build a facility like what TSMC has is on the scale of decades. It would be good for defense if we could on-shore chip fabrication, but it will be extremely costly to do that and the government (taxpayers) will be paying a lot of the cost either through higher prices or subsidies, likely both.

>shrouded as something else

The answer is:  ego.  And it's effect or ""hold"" on the mind.

The ego acts as a ""shield"" to protect the mind from uncomfortable truths it is not ready to accept. If you try to force a person to accept something before the brain is ready you can cause severe trauma. (As in the little boy who was so severely beaten and mistreated by his parents he developed multiple personalities to avoid the pain of reality. Each (personality) of which knew nothing of the other one. I forget his name, but it can be found on the innerwebs). 

It takes a lot of time for truth to seep into a person's mind and for them to accept it as truth. You can't force truth upon them. They have to slowly awaken to it on their own terms and as slow/fast as their intelligence allows.

When I read stories such as yours I think of the person you are describing as an child who puts their fingers in their ears and screams ""La La La La!"" so they don't have to hear whatever is causing them distress.

Some people are really, *really*, stupid.

They heard people say something along the lines of ""manufacturers will have to lower their prices to remain competitive"" and thought that meant the prices they as consumers would pay, would drop.  The reality, of course, is that if a widget normally sells for $100, with tariffs it might be $110.  To remain competitive the manufacturer might lower their price to $95.45 so that the final price consumers see, after tariffs, is $105.  The manufacturer did lower their price, but the consumer still has to pay more than without the tariff.

The funny thing to me is that this guy from OP's screenshot has been posted before, he was complaining about $77 on a ~$5000 purchase.

""Suppose you own a business. You sell pens. Without getting into specifics, it costs you 50 cents to make 10 pens, which you sell for 5 dollars a pack. Of the 5 dollars, employees cost you 1.50 to make the pens, the building costs you 1 dollar in upkeep. And to get the pens to the people who sell them, it costs you a nickle. So on every pack, you make $2.45. Not bad right?""

They nodded.

""So now let's say that one day, the delivery service you use, raised prices. The cost of gasoline due to Brandon's stupid not drilling policy now costs you 2 dollars to ship the package of pens instead of 5 cents.""

They nodded again, a bit more  at the mention of Brandon.

""So if you had to deal with this, what would you do.""

""God damned Brandon. I dunno, probably raise the prices on my pens. And if the prices came down I'd lower it.""

""Right, you'd raise prices. So now instead of you selling pens for 5, you have to sell them for 7 right? Just to keep your money per pack the same""

""Yep.""

Now let's say that you wanna sell your package of pens to a dude overseas. Let's say someone in Germany. Normally he's gotta pay your $5 for your pens. But Germany decided that due to screwing the US that those pens cost more. The German dude still wants your pens but the officials like Merkel are charging you 2 dollars to get him those pens. What would you do?""

""I guess I'd raise prices.""

""Alright. So you'd raise prices. So for the guy who wanted to buy those pens, it's be $7, right?""

""Yeah.""

""Or 9 if you had to pay extra for Brandon's dumb gas rule, right?""

""Yep""

""Well, in this scenario, you're the guy in Germany. You wants to buy those pens from me, but because Germany is making me pay more to send your product to you, you've gotta pay me to make it financially viable to get you those pens.""

""Ok, but why do I have to pay more""

""I'm not paying extra to get you those pens. You want them, you've gotta pay them. Now if I wanna get around it, I could always build a pen making factory near you in germany. But why would I do that when a new factory might cost me a billion dollars to make and upkeep and I'd have to sell 100 billion packs just to make up the difference? It might be cheaper just to let you pay the extra $2 in the hopes that eventually the tariffs go away.""

Blank stare

""Like you said, if you didn't have to pay extra to make it, you wouldn't make me pay for the extra to get it. It's only because the gov't stepped in and said \*I'd like 2 dollars please\*, that makes me pay the extra 2 dollars.""

They were supported by *France* behind the scenes to mess with the Anglo-Prussian Alliance who won the Seven Years' War a decade prior.

Thoughtful version:

Except that it IS a funnel. It always has been. It's just taken this long for the natural and inevitable consequences of capitalism to become obvious to casual observers.

Employers must, by definition, underpay their workers. Because to pay them what their labor was worth would be to pay out the entire profits the company takes in, thus leaving a zero-sum game with no way to grow or expand or enrich yourself when opening a business.

Because it's easier to lead them. I can definitely tell you that people got pissed off when they were told they should get everything they voted for. I can tell you that they voted like it was some season of American Idol and not something that would affect their lives and the lives of others for decades. They sat there celebrating because ""their side"" won. That's all they get. That's all they care about. 

In the Age of FAFO, they will still not understand the ramifications of what they've done. How can they? They literally can't understand what's going on around them, and their views are delivered by Fox News without any real counter. They are locked in, and when the hammer comes down, they will look to whoever their fearless leaders tell them to look to assign blame. IMHO failure is the goal. They're going to treat the country like a failing company. They are going to strip it for parts, get rid of any department that would get in the way, and carve away what forward progress was made to give people some level of equality. 

Depending on how hard they push the gas, the shock to the country will be substantial, and we'll all be too busy trying to survive to stop them from the next stage, which is channeling all of those governmental services through private companies and some of those companies will have crosses on them.

3. Judicial ethics for the SCOTUS
4. Overturn/fix Citizens United - get the firehose of donor money out of politics
5. Ranked choice voting - this encourages moderation and down regulates the ability of extreme candidates to rise to the top (e.g.: Trump -- he won the 2016 primaries because everyone else broke up any sort of mainstream consensus and let the extreme candidate win a plurality) – it also helps reduce the influence of the two-party system.
6. Reduce the influence of lobbyists. 
7. Insider trading in congress - important but they get rich as a side effect of being there, not as much as bribes for decisions made (though they may make decisions to benefit their portfolios).
8. Consider updating the headcount in the house to return it to more representative levels as it had previously been, rather than being capped at 435. – More voices can help break us from this mess.

The entire point of tariffs is to make a foreign good cost as much or more than a local good so that people choose to buy the local good.  First problem is that there are (almost) no US businesses directly in a lot of these markets now. So now first, the prices on everything would have to go way up, until it's high enough for some person to decide its worth the risk to create a company to fill in that market and compete.  Then they'd have to create the business, manufacturing, the material sourcing, the labor pool, etc, etc and then get it going and producing the goods and then get them on selves to be bought.  Even then in the end of the day the prices would be HIGHER because that's why they can compete now.

The risk for someone doing all that is huge too because they are existing entirely because the tariffs are making a space for them to compete and if the tariffs ever go away then suddenly their business collapses.",19,1730756399.0,0

A lot of the specifics were geared towards republican states. He mentioned it will distrupt American auto making. Both countries trade car parts back and forth...

Critical minerals were also mentioned a lot, but it doesn't sound like those will used against America yet but it's on the table.


Trudeau agreed about the need to tackle fentanyl and wished it was wiped off the face of the earth. So there's common ground there. He emphasized this isn't a Canada issue, this is a joint issue. And it sounds like he wants to work with America. He mentioned the Canada/USA boarder only accounts for 1% of the illegal crossings. 

Canada is 1/9 the population and 1/12 the economy compared to USA. But Canada, Mexico and China account up to more than 40% of USA's trade. Interesting to see what China and Mexico do too. This isn't pretty. Hopefully it doesn't last long. ",913,1738463523.0,0

A great deal of ad space is purchased every year for tourism purposes. When our countries were on good terms this is what it was used for. Now that we're not, this is what it's now being used for. We took ad space we had already purchased and ran new ads. We may or may not have gone even further than that, most Redditors in America will have seen one of these ads in person by the end of the week I figure.

There's plenty of threads full of seething Americans, or Russian shills, it's hard to tell the difference any longer.

Instead of using tourism money to invite you all up to enjoy our country with us we're using it to cause a ruckus in your barn, to agitate your citizens.

I learned critical thinking skills that I don’t see often in everyday interactions, I learned *how* to think. 

Empiricism is one of the most valuable tools in critical thinking. I believe capitalism fuels consumerism in such high levels that people are consuming information like m&m’s without taking any thought about where/how/why that information was derived. 

Many people who say “I’m a man of science” or that science is their highest form of belief bc it’s the “only accurate measure of truths” aren’t even cognizant of the idea that science inherently holds bias because humans are doing science. People use their own bias to determine how/why/what science is done. & that’s how/why in 2024(?) we find out that much of health science (sleep science, reproductive science) hasn’t even considered to use women’s sleep patterns or actual menstrual blood for testing products. Why? Because for so long, STEM was a male dominated field. 

Everyone wants to mock about the patriarchy and they don’t realize it’s running this country into the fucking ground. Trump Supporters, look at your gRaNd mAsTeR aLpHa KKKing PATRIARCH & how he’s brought our country to revolution & possible civil war! We have dwindling allies and social support & our taxes aren’t used for anything to benefit us or our lives. Literally taxation without representation thanks to the grand pa(thetic)triarch, Donald Trump :) 

But it’s okay because I’m probably just a lib-tard for taking these views (I don’t believe in either side of this government because they’re all corrupt money hungry oligarchs and two opposing colors won’t change my mind and force me to pick a side).

tax American citizens.

economic sanctions. Presidents have used the IEEPA to target dangerous foreign

actors—primarily terrorist organizations and hostile countries such as Iran, Russia,

I stopped listening to politicians speak and switched to reading transcripts of their statements and debates, etc. years ago.

I just got to a point where the ""American Man Giving A Rousing Political Speech"" voice made me nauseated. They responded to every question asked but the never actually *answered* a single one. Then Chump's voice was physically repulsive and that was it. I think I made it through two straight years of his presidency without hearing his fucking voice in my ear.

I meant to watch Trudeau's speech the other day and read the subtitles but it auto-played his voice.

I cried, honestly. He didn't sound like a politician at all. He sounded like a man who was looking at an old friend about to do something stupid and unforgivable, for no reason, and was trying to give him a last chance for redemption but without begging or panicking or debasing himself in any way to do it.

He just sounded so fucking normal and real, like he was saying what he really believed, and without putting someone else down to do it.

I cried. I wanted to live in a country run by people who did their best, even if their best wasn't that good.

Now I'm just hoping to live long enough to have a hand in this fight before I get put down by a family member for being a ""radical leftist lunatic"". 

I don't want to pay the tariff because I don't want to give any money to this government, but I'd rather buy Canadian than spend a fucking dime at an American Maga-corp.

I've been crying every day for days now. Not like sobbing, just going about my business and realizing I'm crying. Pumping gas- oh, I'm crying. Huh. Buying cat food- oh, shit, I'm crying. Working on a client- oh good. Crying again. Just literally walking around realizing my eyes are running.

I can share my anecdote from what I see every week when I'm grocery shopping. I typically go to the 'value' grocery chains, even where you're most likely to see people struggling on shoestring budgets. Bins for USA products are full and starting to rot, while products from Mexico, the Philippines, and others are selling fast.

Grocery chains have begun to reflect the new buying habits by simply not carrying USA products since they won't sell. People who are struggling are willingly taking a financial hit as an act of patriotism for Canada.

I'm also seeing a new practice become much more common, when shoppers identify an American product, they have taken to flipping the products upside down to signal to other shoppers the product is American. I actually thought this was just a social media thing until this weekend when I started witnessing it in person. Noticing this, grocery stores are starting to also update the price tags with Canadian flags to signal that it is a product of Canada.

This is going to get worse before it gets better. Based on the general unawareness of Americans cited in your post, it seems like its going to need to hurt before changes start happening.

I've noticed this is often described as a response to tariffs, and for some this may be the case, but the general energy here is coming from President Trump's repeated claims of his intention to annex Canada. The unity here is wild; politically unaware people are suddenly aware and involved. I had a DnD in-person finale recently and I was in charge of our meals for 3 days. they were delighted to hear I went through the effort to exclude American products in my buying and prioritize Canada. It doesn't have to be this way, but it seems it may need to be for some time still.

One of the best descriptions of Trumps negotiation tactic(s) is from David Honig. I stumbled over this a few weeks ago, interesting read:

“I’m going to get a little wonky and write about Donald Trump and negotiations. For those who don’t know, I’m an adjunct professor at Indiana University - Robert H. McKinney School of Law and I teach negotiations. Okay, here goes.

Trump, as most of us know, is the credited author of “The Art of the Deal,” a book that was actually ghost written by a man named Tony Schwartz, who was given access to Trump and wrote based upon his observations. If you’ve read The Art of the Deal, or if you’ve followed Trump lately, you’ll know, even if you didn’t know the label, that he sees all dealmaking as what we call “distributive bargaining.”

Distributive bargaining always has a winner and a loser. It happens when there is a fixed quantity of something and two sides are fighting over how it gets distributed. Think of it as a pie and you’re fighting over who gets how many pieces. In Trump’s world, the bargaining was for a building, or for the construction work, or subcontractors. He perceives a successful bargain as one in which there is a winner and a loser, so if he pays less than the seller wants, he wins. The more he saves the more he wins.

The other type of bargaining is called integrative bargaining. In integrative bargaining the two sides don’t have a complete conflict of interest, and it is possible to reach mutually beneficial agreements. Think of it, not a single pie to be divided by two hungry people, but as a baker and a caterer negotiating over how many pies will be baked at what prices, and the nature of their ongoing relationship after this one gig is over.

The problem with Trump is that he sees only distributive bargaining in an international world that requires integrative bargaining. He can raise tariffs, but so can other countries. He can’t demand they not respond. There is no defined end to the negotiation and there is no simple winner and loser. There are always more pies to be baked. Further, negotiations aren’t binary. China’s choices aren’t (a) buy soybeans from US farmers, or (b) don’t buy soybeans. They can also (c) buy soybeans from Russia, or Argentina, or Brazil, or Canada, etc. That completely strips the distributive bargainer of his power to win or lose, to control the negotiation.

One of the risks of distributive bargaining is bad will. In a one-time distributive bargain, e.g. negotiating with the cabinet maker in your casino about whether you’re going to pay his whole bill or demand a discount, you don’t have to worry about your ongoing credibility or the next deal. If you do that to the cabinet maker, you can bet he won’t agree to do the cabinets in your next casino, and you’re going to have to find another cabinet maker.

There isn’t another Canada.

So when you approach international negotiation, in a world as complex as ours, with integrated economies and multiple buyers and sellers, you simply must approach them through integrative bargaining. If you attempt distributive bargaining, success is impossible. And we see that already.

Trump has raised tariffs on China. China responded, in addition to raising tariffs on US goods, by dropping all its soybean orders from the US and buying them from Russia. The effect is not only to cause tremendous harm to US farmers, but also to increase Russian revenue, making Russia less susceptible to sanctions and boycotts, increasing its economic and political power in the world, and reducing ours. Trump saw steel and aluminum and thought it would be an easy win, BECAUSE HE SAW ONLY STEEL AND ALUMINUM - HE SEES EVERY NEGOTIATION AS DISTRIBUTIVE. China saw it as integrative, and integrated Russia and its soybean purchase orders into a far more complex negotiation ecosystem.

Trump has the same weakness politically. For every winner there must be a loser. And that’s just not how politics works, not over the long run.

For people who study negotiations, this is incredibly basic stuff, negotiations 101, definitions you learn before you even start talking about styles and tactics. And here’s another huge problem for us.

Trump is utterly convinced that his experience in a closely held real estate company has prepared him to run a nation, and therefore he rejects the advice of people who spent entire careers studying the nuances of international negotiations and diplomacy. But the leaders on the other side of the table have not eschewed expertise, they have embraced it. And that means they look at Trump and, given his very limited tool chest and his blindly distributive understanding of negotiation, they know exactly what he is going to do and exactly how to respond to it.

From a professional negotiation point of view, Trump isn’t even bringing checkers to a chess match. He’s bringing a quarter that he insists on flipping for heads or tails, while everybody else is studying the chess board to decide whether its better to open with Najdorf or Grünfeld.”

How could it not be? If it wasn’t beneficial to both parties, one of them would simply have refused to make that deal, and the deal wouldn’t exist.

Of course, the real world isn’t perfect. Sometimes, deals that aren’t beneficial get made anyway — there’s incompetent or irrational actors after all. But generally, if you see a deal (trade between two countries at a macro level, a consumer buying food at a micro level, etc), it’s something that benefits both parties. 

From there you actually dont need to know very much about why these things work the way they do. Doesn’t matter if you don’t understand *why* some trades are profitable — just looking at the world right now: countries trade with each other. It’s a thing that happens. Ergo, countries trading with each other is something that benefits both countries — it creates wealth for both.

Now, sure, you could get a bigger part of the pie and have better deals where the other party is slightly unhappier and you’re slightly happier. Or deals where both parties are happier, too — that’s something that can happen, necessarily. But from your layman understanding of the universe and why trade happens, it’s pretty trivial to see what happens if you put barriers on trade with every single country and reduce/stop it: everyone simply gets poorer.  ",222,1744080857.0,2

Trump is hoping that by putting up the cost of imported (mainly Chinese) goods, that will spur US companies to make these goods.

T minus twenty minutes, you suddenly see a massive amount of insider trade activity as Trump and people close to him suddenly bought a bunch of SPY calls.

At T minus zero, Trump announces on his social media platform that tarrifs are now on a 90 day pause for countries which didn't retaliate. The stock market immediately erupts with a +400 point gain, making anyone who bought SPY calls 20 minutes ago extremely rich.

The rest of the retail investors react to the news within seconds/minutes, causing a massive gain. The insiders probably offloaded all of their SPY calls, effectively stealing hundreds of millions from investors, pension funds, hard working retail investors, etc. IT WAS GRAND THEFT FROM ALL OF US!!!!

It's so fucked. Think about it. If someone goes to rob a bank with a gun and fill a sack with cash, they might be lucky to run away with $30,000. And if they get caught? The sentencing for armed robbery is extreme. All for $30k. But if you are a politician with insider trading info and make a few trades to steal $300,000,000, not only will you get away with it, but you won't even be charged if you get caught -- they're like 10,000x worse than the bank robber.

Raise the auto manufacturer's costs, then tell them they have to eat the loss and not make a profit. The 0.1% short the US auto companies. They'll start reporting lower than expected quarterly earnings, dropping the share prices.  Auto sector declines bring a Bing chunk of the rest of the market down too, allowing the 0.1% to scoop up stocks at baragin rates.  Ford, GM, etc eventually come out and say ""can't do it anymore"", stock tanks even further, the shorts make their money.

This goes hand in hand with his push to secure minerals in other territories because America doesn't have access to all the minerals its industries do/will need. This in turn goes hand in hand with a view of the world as made up of big players, e.g. china, (Russia?), etc. And he wants America to be self sufficient in its competition with them - rather than dependent on companies/industry/minerals based in other nations. This is, from this perspective, because the post cold war consensus that ""liberal democracy has 'won' and will bring the world prosperity and peace"" is wrong headed and we are now in the post-post-cold-war global reality of a new competition between nations.

He thinks he can strengthen Americas position against the big global players by bullying the nations in its own orbit - Canada, European nations, etc. into giving America more. 

This is, obviously, a fundamental change in the way America is using its power.

You said their houses were being ignored, as though FEMA was rolling through knocking on doors asking if people needed help, and skipping houses with Trump flags.

And then I’ll see some rebel Republican, you know, some guy that wants to grandstand, saying: ‘I think that Congress should take over negotiations.’ Let me tell you: you don’t negotiate like I negotiate.”

Trump also told the audience that, ""I really think we're helped a lot by the tariff situation that’s going on, which is a good situation, not a bad. It's great. It’s going to be legendary, you watch. Legendary in a positive way, I have to say. It’s gonna be legendary.”

We're not talking about them all making a sure-bet 9% on the rise in the market today after the announcement. With creative investing instruments, one could make not only a multiple of that gain, but \*many times\* their original investment. Their are people in the Trump orbit who today turned millions into tens, or even hundreds, on millions.

It's actually pretty smart if you don't have a moral compass and seek the maximum financial advantage, consequences on everyone else be damned.

What else really besides tariffs allows the president to move markets -- both upward and down -- at his will, without instituting any permanent policy? Just on his word, they've discovered now that they can basically send the \*entire\* market up or down about 10%. With insider information ahead of time, one could make almost unlimited proceeds betting before the rise or dip.

Using margin leverage and derivatives, they bet on outlier moves in the market, which normally would be very rare, but here they know they're almost certain to happen with such world-shaking announcements.

1jsxpjx,mlrn1nc,t1_mlq6r6q,ButchTookMySweetroll,"The best way I’ve seen it put is a quote I ~~shamelessly stole~~ saved from another thread:

“I’m going to get a little wonky and write about Donald Trump and negotiations. For those who don’t know, I’m an adjunct professor at Indiana University - Robert H. McKinney School of Law and I teach negotiations. Okay, here goes.

Trump, as most of us know, is the credited author of “The Art of the Deal,” a book that was actually ghost written by a man named Tony Schwartz, who was given access to Trump and wrote based upon his observations. If you’ve read The Art of the Deal, or if you’ve followed Trump lately, you’ll know, even if you didn’t know the label, that he sees all dealmaking as what we call “distributive bargaining.”

Distributive bargaining always has a winner and a loser. It happens when there is a fixed quantity of something and two sides are fighting over how it gets distributed. Think of it as a pie and you’re fighting over who gets how many pieces. In Trump’s world, the bargaining was for a building, or for the construction work, or subcontractors. He perceives a successful bargain as one in which there is a winner and a loser, so if he pays less than the seller wants, he wins. The more he saves the more he wins.

The other type of bargaining is called integrative bargaining. In integrative bargaining the two sides don’t have a complete conflict of interest, and it is possible to reach mutually beneficial agreements. Think of it, not a single pie to be divided by two hungry people, but as a baker and a caterer negotiating over how many pies will be baked at what prices, and the nature of their ongoing relationship after this one gig is over.

The problem with Trump is that he sees only distributive bargaining in an international world that requires integrative bargaining. He can raise tariffs, but so can other countries. He can’t demand they not respond. There is no defined end to the negotiation and there is no simple winner and loser. There are always more pies to be baked. Further, negotiations aren’t binary. China’s choices aren’t (a) buy soybeans from US farmers, or (b) don’t buy soybeans. They can also (c) buy soybeans from Russia, or Argentina, or Brazil, or Canada, etc. That completely strips the distributive bargainer of his power to win or lose, to control the negotiation.

One of the risks of distributive bargaining is bad will. In a one-time distributive bargain, e.g. negotiating with the cabinet maker in your casino about whether you’re going to pay his whole bill or demand a discount, you don’t have to worry about your ongoing credibility or the next deal. If you do that to the cabinet maker, you can bet he won’t agree to do the cabinets in your next casino, and you’re going to have to find another cabinet maker.

There isn’t another Canada.

So when you approach international negotiation, in a world as complex as ours, with integrated economies and multiple buyers and sellers, you simply must approach them through integrative bargaining. If you attempt distributive bargaining, success is  impossible. And we see that already.

Trump has raised tariffs on China. China responded, in addition to raising tariffs on US goods, by dropping all its soybean orders from the US and buying them from Russia. The effect is not only to cause tremendous harm to US farmers, but also to increase Russian revenue, making Russia less susceptible to sanctions and boycotts, increasing its economic and political power in the world, and reducing ours. Trump saw steel and aluminum and thought it would be an easy win, BECAUSE HE SAW ONLY STEEL AND ALUMINUM - HE SEES EVERY NEGOTIATION AS DISTRIBUTIVE. China saw it as integrative, and integrated Russia and its soybean purchase orders into a far more complex negotiation ecosystem.

Trump has the same weakness politically. For every winner there must be a loser. And that’s just not how politics works, not over the long run.

For people who study negotiations, this is incredibly basic stuff, negotiations 101, definitions you learn before you even start talking about styles and tactics. And here’s another huge problem for us.

Trump is utterly convinced that his experience in a closely held real estate company has prepared him to run a nation, and therefore he rejects the advice of people who spent entire careers studying the nuances of international negotiations and diplomacy. But the leaders on the other side of the table have not eschewed expertise, they have embraced it. And that means they look at Trump and, given his very limited tool chest and his blindly distributive understanding of negotiation, they know exactly what he is going to do and exactly how to respond to it.

From a professional negotiation point of view, Trump isn’t even bringing checkers to a chess match. He’s bringing a quarter that he insists on flipping for heads or tails, while everybody else is studying the chess board to decide whether its better to open with Najdorf or Grünfeld.”

If I buy $100 of gold from you neither of us is richer. I have $100 worth of gold and you have $100 worth of currency. But if we’re different countries it’s labeled a “trade deficit”. 

Having a trade deficit with one country is totally irrelevant if your balance of trade across all countries is in line. The problem arises when you’re giving the world a whole bunch of your currency but then you don’t have anything they want to buy with it: your currency value tanks and now you can’t buy anything anymore (simplistically). 

But for the USA even that hasn’t been an issue because of the special nature of the US dollar. Other countries use our currency to trade between one another.

So ya, a trade deficit with a specific country is fine. A global trade deficit can be bad, but isn’t even that bad for the USA anyway.

Edit to add: Tariffs are not useless. Their use is political. You’re intentionally creating an inefficiency to change behavior.

Early on in this mess, Trump said that the U.S. was getting ""ripped off"" by Canada to the tune of $80 billion a year, referring to the USA/CAD trade deficit.  He also characterized this as a ""subsidy.""

Most people who stayed awake through high school understand that the trade deficit (how much Canada imports from the USA vs how much the USA imports from Canada) is a natural consequence of the two countries' respective population; there a simply ~10X more customers on the southern side of the border, so it could hardly be otherwise.

Far from being ripped off, decades of negotiations have created many trade agreements with very favourable conditions for the USA.

Paradoxically, Trump insists that the U.S.A doesn't *need* Canadian products or resources.  It will be interesting to see how U.S. construction goes without Canadian lumber, and what kind of impact having to pay tariffs on potash have on their agricultural industry.  (More than three quarters of US potash imports come from Canada.  They are able to produce about 1/20th that they need domestically.

""Elect me, I'll make groceries affordable!""  ""How?""  ""Well, first we're going to deport all the migrant workers whose cheap labour you've come to take for granted, and then we're going to alienate our closest trading partner so farmers pay more for fertilizer.

Columbia University’s Robert O. Paxton—an expert in Nazi Germany, Mussolini’s Italy, and Vichy France—published these “ten elements” in his *The Anatomy of Fascism* (2004) to recognize when a democracy ceases to be liberal and embraces fascism. Here they are:

1. A Sense of Crisis: Fascist movements emerge in times of perceived national decline or crisis, promising renewal and strength.

2. Rejection of Liberal Democracy: Fascists view democracy, pluralism, and individual rights as weak and ineffective, advocating instead for an authoritarian state.

3. The Cult of Action for Action’s Sake: Violence and action are glorified as expressions of strength and decisiveness, often at the expense of intellectual debate or deliberation.

4. An Exclusionary Nationalism: Fascism promotes an extreme form of nationalism that defines the nation in ethnocultural terms and excludes perceived outsiders.

5. Glorification of a Mythic Past: Fascists appeal to an idealized version of history, often emphasizing a lost golden age that must be restored.

6. A Leader-Centered Movement: Fascist regimes rely on charismatic leaders who embody the movement and claim to speak for the nation.

7. Militarization of Politics: Fascists use paramilitary groups, intimidation, and violence to achieve political goals.

8. Hostility to Leftist Movements: Fascists strongly oppose socialism, Marxism, and labor movements, often aligning with conservative elites to suppress leftist threats.

9. Economic Control in Service of the State: Fascist regimes do not abolish private property but subordinate economic activity to the needs of the state, often in cooperation with industrialists.

10. Manipulation of Electoral and Legal Systems: Even when coming to power through legal means, fascists work to dismantle democratic institutions once in control.

Because Canada did not do anything to provoke the tariffs, only a fool would express certainty in terms of what Canada could do to make them end. 

And while I still place the odds of an attempted annexation on the lower end, it's a possibility, and placing odds on anything is really a fool's errand with the relevant variables almost all being so radically unstable. We used to imagine, and it wasn't so completely off base, that we could at least kind of predict a few years, maybe even a decade into the future in the study of international relations. Some of the extremely pompous Big Men of the discipline thought they could predict into eternity, but they were always idiots high on their own supply, because we're dealing with units and structures that didn't even exist before the inter-war period, then gradually came into play in 1945 and through the 1960s. 

But now it's like the long-term weather forecast. Anything further than a week ahead, you don't take too seriously, because so many variables can shift in that time. The game has changed, we don't know why the most powerful players do what they do, we don't know who or what might contain them domestically, we don't know if we can count on international allies, and we don't know if we can do anything to change what they do.

If you just mean it's not a good time for North America when all that is accurate, then I agree. But if you take issue with him stating those facts, we are in less of an alignment.

The one thing we can take charge of is ourselves. Despite all of the above, I still think the greatest single risk to Canada is the risk that, in fighting monsters, we become fascist ourselves.

It didn't match exit polling by like a 40% swing, which is unheard of.

But that same system was running back in 2020 also, and Trump assumed it would work well enough to put him over the top.

Such a 'spike' may indicate election result falsification, particularly if only one candidate appears to benefit.

1j9jsf7,mhe0isp,t1_mhdwf8h,NorthStarZero,"The answer is simple. Not *easy*, mind you, but simple. 

Do everything you can to remove American influence from your life. 

Some of this is just changing your purchasing habits: be aware of where stuff you buy is made, choose Canadian-sourced products when you can, non-American when you cannot. 

At work, speak up whenever there is an occasion when your business interfaces with Americans. Remind people that it is in the country’s best interests to diversify outside of the American sphere. Contribute to company policy. 

Get involved in local politics. Get to know your representatives and their rivals. Take solace when you discover that most of them are actually trying to make the country better. Find out whose platform best meshes with your own ideals. Give feedback. When elections happen, be sure to vote and make sure that vote is an informed one. 

None of these things are Herculanian tasks, but the aggregate of everyone following a similar strategy will help keep the nation sane. And never underestimate the value of the example you might be setting. 

We’ll get through this, together. The end state is a Canada that is not so heavily tied to the US, so the next time this happens (and there *will* be a next time) it will be a national nothingburger.

He seriously suggested that he could pay down the deficit in 7 years as he was the 'king of debt'. When asked how, he said he'd only pay back 80% of what they owed.

Saw this on r/Iowa


“I’m going to get a little wonky and write about Donald Trump and negotiations. For those who don’t know, I’m an adjunct professor at Indiana University - Robert H. McKinney School of Law and I teach negotiations. Okay, here goes.

Trump, as most of us know, is the credited author of “The Art of the Deal,” a book that was actually ghost written by a man named Tony Schwartz, who was given access to Trump and wrote based upon his observations. If you’ve read The Art of the Deal, or if you’ve followed Trump lately, you’ll know, even if you didn’t know the label, that he sees all dealmaking as what we call “distributive bargaining.”

Distributive bargaining always has a winner and a loser. It happens when there is a fixed quantity of something and two sides are fighting over how it gets distributed. Think of it as a pie and you’re fighting over who gets how many pieces. In Trump’s world, the bargaining was for a building, or for construction work, or subcontractors. He perceives a successful bargain as one in which there is a winner and a loser, so if he pays less than the seller wants, he wins. The more he saves the more he wins.

The other type of bargaining is called integrative bargaining. In integrative bargaining the two sides don’t have a complete conflict of interest, and it is possible to reach mutually beneficial agreements. Think of it, not a single pie to be divided by two hungry people, but as a baker and a caterer negotiating over how many pies will be baked at what prices, and the nature of their ongoing relationship after this one gig is over.

The problem with Trump is that he sees only distributive bargaining in an international world that requires integrative bargaining. He can raise tariffs, but so can other countries. He can’t demand they not respond. There is no defined end to the negotiation and there is no simple winner and loser. There are always more pies to be baked. Further, negotiations aren’t binary. China’s choices aren’t (a) buy soybeans from US farmers, or (b) don’t buy soybeans. They can also (c) buy soybeans from Russia, or Argentina, or Brazil, or Canada, etc. That completely strips the distributive bargainer of his power to win or lose, to control the negotiation.

One of the risks of distributive bargaining is bad will. In a one-time distributive bargain, e.g. negotiating with the cabinet maker in your casino about whether you’re going to pay his whole bill or demand a discount, you don’t have to worry about your ongoing credibility or the next deal. If you do that to the cabinet maker, you can bet he won’t agree to do the cabinets in your next casino, and you’re going to have to find another cabinet maker.

There isn’t another Canada.

So when you approach international negotiation, in a world as complex as ours, with integrated economies and multiple buyers and sellers, you simply must approach them through integrative bargaining. If you attempt distributive bargaining, success is  impossible. And we see that already.

Trump has raised tariffs on China. China responded, in addition to raising tariffs on US goods, by dropping all its soybean orders from the US and buying them from Russia. The effect is not only to cause tremendous harm to US farmers, but also to increase Russian revenue, making Russia less susceptible to sanctions and boycotts, increasing its economic and political power in the world, and reducing ours. Trump saw steel and aluminum and thought it would be an easy win, BECAUSE HE SAW ONLY STEEL AND ALUMINUM - HE SEES EVERY NEGOTIATION AS DISTRIBUTIVE. China saw it as integrative, and integrated Russia and its soybean purchase orders into a far more complex negotiation ecosystem.

Trump has the same weakness politically. For every winner there must be a loser. And that’s just not how politics works, not over the long run.

For people who study negotiations, this is incredibly basic stuff, negotiations 101, definitions you learn before you even start talking about styles and tactics. And here’s another huge problem for us.

Trump is utterly convinced that his experience in a closely held real estate company has prepared him to run a nation, and therefore he rejects the advice of people who spent entire careers studying the nuances of international negotiations and diplomacy. But the leaders on the other side of the table have not eschewed expertise, they have embraced it. And that means they look at Trump and, given his very limited tool chest and his blindly distributive understanding of negotiation, they know exactly what he is going to do and exactly how to respond to it.

From a professional negotiation point of view, Trump isn’t even bringing checkers to a chess match. He’s bringing a quarter that he insists of flipping for heads or tails, while everybody else is studying the chess board to decide whether its better to open with Najdorf or Grünfeld.”

He wants to slap a tariff on *everything* from China.

The problem is America doesn’t produce a lot of the stuff that is imported from China. Laptops and electronics aren’t made in the US. Raw material industries like steel and aluminium took a decades long decline due to cheap Chinese alternatives becoming available. You can’t just spin up an entire resources/electronics manufacturing industry in a year or two. 

It would take decades and let’s not forget the reason these industries left the US in the first place: it’s cheaper to outsource it to China. The American consumer demanded a cheaper product, the US corporations wanted to cut costs, so manufacturing was outsourced. 

So it doesn’t mean that consumers switch to American-made alternatives (as they don’t exist), and end up paying more for the same products.

He didn’t bring back America’s steel industry during his last term as president, and won’t if he wins again in November.

So, it's not about making a $20 profit on each shirt you sell, it's about making a 100% profit on every dollar you invest in inventory. If the cost of the shirt increases from $20 to $30, then the price of the shirt will increase from $40 to $60.",12,1731330152.0,1

My father always tried to be genuine and supportive to people in his life. He isn't what most would call a ""bad guy"". Not by a long shot. 

And yet he fell into right wing politics. When I was younger, it was just as sort of a mild curiosity. But when he got divorced from my mom, he started to indulge that side more and more. He became ""religious"". He started talking about Obama, and how he was letting ""Sharia law"" take over. 

He isn't a Trump supporter. Didn't support him in the 2015 primaries, and he has recently called Trump ""a huge mistake"". But that only means he voted for the libertarian candidate. 

He won't support Trump, but at the same time it is impossible to have a conversation with him about what's going on in politics because he refuses to acknowlege that what Trump is doing is *terrible*. He acts like he's merely a ""lame"" president, rather than an obvious overreaching authoriatrian. 

The other day on the phone I was trying to rationalize with him. I was trying to share my apprehension about the coming economic situation. I am in my mid 30s. I am not rich, and my familiy recently had a financial set back. We are still ""OK"", but a really bad six months could wreck us. Our dream of a home, of a future better than our present, won't happen. 

My dad, who is retired on a military pension, got a good chunk of money from his father passing that he invested and made money on, responded to my fears by saying, ""well, I'll be OK if things go bad. I bought a lot of gold."" 

And it really just hit me. Like, this is what he's become. His son is sharing genuine fears about what the person in power is going to do, and his first reaction is about how *he* will be OK, because he has a little pile of gold he thinks will keep him safe.

My father wouldn't say he's MAGA. But MAGA is a small part of the overall problem in the states. Most people are more like my father than anything. They're scared, small people who had big ideals when they were young, and let them get battered down by the corrupt world that they allowed to spring up around them. They capitulated to almighty capital, and so long as *they* feel secure, they are incapable of truly seeing or helping anyone else. 

It's really, really sad. I hate that he's like this. I hate that he cannot, or will not, see what he's become, or what is becoming of the world around him. His fear, and pride, and stubbornness all keep him trapped in this deeply unwell bubble of denial.",21,1746230904.0,2

Things get bad enough they'll get to watch their own house burn right in front of their eyes. 


The second US Civil War won't be between the North and South across a geographic line, it'll be neighbor versus neighbor. We've seen it on the news happen in other countries, now we're a hair's breadth from seeing it in person in our own streets and neighborhoods.  


All it's going to take is some MAGA psychopaths putting on their brown shirts and going out to harm other Americans, and I predict the free-for-all gates will open.  Contrary to the popular meme, the ""Left"" in this country is not disarmed and afraid of guns, because as anyone looking at the Overton Window of American politics can see the supposed ""Left"" is mostly Centrists, and the Second Amendment has not solely been utilized by the fascist Right to arm up.  



But it will be fucking *nasty*, neighborhood militias forming based upon ideologies, families drive from homes at gunpoint to secure territories from internal betrayal and form defensive perimeters, millions of people out of work, food and goods shortages, collapse of the economy, basically the worst of the Palestinian and Jewish (Israel didn't exist yet) conflict of 1946-1948 at the end of the British Mandate.


And that's exactly what Putin and his fascist Russian government want to happen - for us to destroy ourselves.  In the middle of all that China will then move on Taiwan and hell maybe even some of the Philippines because by then the US will be completely engrossed in eating itself alive at the time and unable to respond when even the military are having to pick between the Constitution and their Oaths or fascism and autocracy. 


And driving us up here to this precipice is all the fault of the MAGA Reich.  I just hope that if they continue to Fuck Around as they have been over the past 6 weeks (nevermind since Jan 6th 2021) that they at least all Find Out big time if/when they finally push too far.",175,1741107700.0,3

This is their economy with debt climbing at a faster rate than the Biden administration that correlates directly with the trump administrations actions and decisions.     
He speaks like a man created hardlanding was the only option for this while ignoring the lowest hanging fruit like taxing billionaires and their capital gains, holding corporations accountable for its tax debt, busting up large conglomerates that are exploiting pricing because of purchasing power (Kroger). Rates likely would have been cut.        
My assumption is even if a deal is done with China it will be drastically worse than it was before - it’ll be a small kick save.

Taiwan: Dominates the fabrication stage, with TSMC leading the world in advanced semiconductor manufacturing (e.g., 3nm and 5nm nodes). They’re unmatched in producing chips at cutting-edge levels, making Taiwan indispensable for modern tech.

USA: Excels in design (think Intel, NVIDIA, AMD) and EDA tools (software for chip design like Synopsys and Cadence). While the U.S. has fabs, it historically relies on Taiwan for advanced chip production. The CHIPS Act is trying to bring more fabrication back to the U.S.

[Update 2005-Jan-28 The USA is only mentioned due to the sources I am referring from. This was only a summary but we all are interconnected and need one another. The USA portion isn't independent of knowing that the companies, although based on the USA, are formed by the world's talented people. My post has missed things like Dutch/Norwegian? and other contributions, machines, manufacturing, etc. We were only talking about the supply chain that affected the world that winds up in Taiwan that Trump's work is hurting the USA itself.

Both are crucial: Taiwan for making chips, the USA for designing and innovating them.

- Trump inherited a growing economy. All he had to do was ride those coattails, but as soon as a real crisis emerged—the covid pandemic—he mismanaged it at every turn and left office with the economy in tatters. While in the aftermath, he succeeded in scapegoating others like Dr Fauci and Joe Biden. What's frustrating, is that Trump will be inheriting a growing economy for the second time.

- An economic crisis occurred at the end of the last two Republican administrations. A democrat president stepped in both times and was forced to oversee an economic recovery and handle the subsequent fallout. Republicans exploited both opportunities to point fingers at their opponents, choosing to take advantage of a crisis for political gain and campaign talking points.

- Under Trump, the national debt ballooned by nearly 40% 

- Trump's tax cuts legislation, which disproportionately and permanently benefited the rich and corporations, did not ""pay for itself,"" and has/will cost the government an estimated trillions.

- Trump put pressure on the fed to keep interest rates low for a political edge. This only worsened inflationary issues.

- The Trump administration hamstringed the labor movement, made it more difficult for workers to unionize and operate effectively.

- Trump didn't just mismanage the pandemic, but he shirked responsibility and encouraged his supporters to politicize every aspect of COVID, dividing Americans during a time of crisis.

- Trump started a trade war with China and his tariff policies were disastrous for Americans.

*It must be emphasized that all of these things and more contributed to economic and inflationary issues that extended into the Biden administration.*

Now, to elaborate more on Trump's tariffs.

Most economists agree that tariffs, especially if they're not carefully implemented, generally do more harm than good, and disproportionately hurt lower income Americans.

This was made evident by Trump's tariff policies and the trade war he instigated during his presidency. To put it simply, it hurt Americans BIGLY. 

And now he's proposing higher, across the board tariffs that will have even worse economic impacts.

We haven't seen tariff policies like this since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which accelerated the Great Depression and brought global trade to a stand still.

The process of determining tariff rates is a delicate one, and a process that Trump couldn't be bothered with. It should involve complex negotiations and careful considerations. Things Trump couldn't care less about. This is precisely why the Biden/Harris administration was forced to reform Trump's tariff policies, adopting a more calculated approach. One that could not simply reverse Trump's policies *because* of the risks involved.

Trump's tariffs have and will generate economic tensions, raise prices, hurt domestic industries and pass costs down to the consumer.

They will also hurt rural communities just as much, if not more than they will Americans living in cities. While small businesses will face economic challenges of their own as they have fewer resources and less power to manage the consequences.

> In general, it is believed that Trump’s tariffs did more harm than good, costing companies billions of dollars and reducing the demand for exported goods that were hit with retaliatory tariffs.

> In a survey of economists conducted by Reuters, the Trump administration’s tariffs were very poorly received. Almost 80% of the 60 economists surveyed believed that the tariffs... would actually harm the U.S. economy... All in all, none of the economists surveyed thought that the tariffs would benefit the economy.

> A CNBC study discovered that Trump’s tariffs actually hurt consumers greatly and equaled one of the largest U.S. tax increases in decades. Researchers have also found that the Trump tariffs lowered the real income of American workers and reduced GDP. In 2021, the Biden administration worked to undo many of these harmful trade barriers.

And when it comes to the trade deficit that Trump blames Biden for:

***The U.S. trade deficit grew under Trump’s tariffs, from $481 billion in 2016 to $679 billion in 2020.***

The trade war Trump started targeted American farmers and agricultural workers in the Midwest most of all, These are the same political groups that voted for him in droves.

As the trade war continued:

> tariffs were also shown to reduce employment and economic output, impacting the overall U.S. economy and people’s livelihoods. The tariffs also did significant damage to relationships with other countries, particularly allies

Trump's current tariff policies have been picked apart by most economists, and the consequences are estimated to be severe. This is what Harris was talking about when she referred to Trump's ""national sales tax."" Most of the damage is expected to trickle down to consumers and small businesses. While it's very likely that Trump doesn't even know how tariffs work.

Trump is not an ""economic genius,"" he is a notorious financial fraud who lies about his wealth and threatens to sue anyone who speculates about his *real* worth. He's bankrupted or crippled practically every business, product or service he's tried to slap his name on.

Trump has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of them including financial crimes.

Tax information also shows that over a period of time in the 80s and 90s, Trump had lost more money than any other American taxpayer. What a loser! Literally...

Donald Trump is not some financial guru, his administrations ""economic achievements,"" by most metrics, benefitted the rich at the expense of everyone else. His greatest financial achievement was inheriting daddy's empire.

Before The Apprentice, Trump had squandered his riches, and if it weren't for his lucky reality TV show break, he'd be known as the failure he was always destined to be.

The next Trump administration will destroy what's left of the labor movement, which has been in steady decline ever since Reagan stepped into office. Don't forget Trump's recent remarks in front of a crowd of union workers, where he said he ""hated"" giving overtime pay.

Over the next four years, the MAGA coalition will use Trump to implement an agenda that will continue to redistribute wealth to the top, an agenda that Republicans have been working towards for decades.

Even Trump's immigration policies, and his plan for the ""mass deportation"" of immigrants, will reduce our economy, as it's estimated that Immigrants add trillions of dollars to our GDP.
