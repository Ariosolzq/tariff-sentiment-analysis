They pour the rest down the drains. If we allowed Americans unrestricted access to our dairy market, it would destroy Canada's entire dairy industry *overnight*.\n\nWell why does that matter, Canada would get access to cheap dairy anyway?\n\n[gestures vaguely]\n\n*This* is why. The same reason people worry when a Walmart moves into their small town. Once the Canadian dairy industry is shuttered, there's no incentive on American suppliers to keep prices down, and at any time, the USA could simply decide to turn off the milk faucet, and now a huge part of Canadians' diets vanishes from the shelves. That has immense potential to cause destabilization. It is, quite literally, a matter of national security.\n\nPeople say, \"if you don't have freedom, you don't have anything\" - yeah well, if you don't have food, you have even less than that.",

Won’t be for sale ever.”\n\nThe two leaders complimented each other multiple times during the meeting, a stark contrast from Trump's icy relationship with Trudeau, whom he regularly taunted as \"Governor Trudeau.\"\n\nBut it remains to be seen whether this comity will last, and whether Carney will be able to use the initial goodwill to turn down some of Trump’s pressure on his country when it comes to trade and Canada’s sovereignty.\n\nEven as Carney insisted his country wasn’t ever going to be for sale, Trump replied, “Never say never.”",

    "selftext": "The Los Angeles Dodgers—Jackie Robinson’s team, the team of Ebbets Field, of resistance, of breaking barriers—just stepped into the White House and gave legitimacy to a man unraveling American democracy before our eyes.\n\nThey stood and smiled next to a president who jails his critics. Who has weaponized the justice system against political enemies. Who uses tariffs not to protect workers but to punish dissent. Who spreads hate, fear, and lies like wildfire.\n\nThis isn’t tradition.\nThis isn’t “just a team visit.”\nThis is normalization.\nThis is appeasement.\n\nAnd if you love baseball, you should be furious.\n\nBecause baseball has always been more than a game. It’s been a mirror of who we are. It broke the color line before the country did. It stood tall through world wars, recessions, and reckonings. And now? The Dodgers—one of the most iconic franchises in the sport—just handed their legacy to an authoritarian regime for a photo op.\n\nLet’s talk about history.\n\nIn 1936, American athletes went to Berlin and saluted Hitler. They said it was about sport. They said it was apolitical.\nIn 1973, Chile’s elites posed with Pinochet as his military rounded up and tortured dissidents.\nIn 1940s Italy, celebrities played along while Mussolini crushed civil rights and censored truth.\n\nThey all told themselves they were “just following tradition.”\nThey all believed they were above the politics of their time.\nAnd every one of them was swallowed by the moment they refused to confront.\n\nThat’s what the Dodgers just did.\n\nThis wasn’t silence. It was a statement:\nThat this regime is acceptable.\nThat there’s no line too far.\nThat money, comfort, and access matter more than truth, justice, and democracy.\n\nAnd for any baseball fan who still believes in the soul of this game? You should feel betrayed.\n\nBecause baseball isn’t about power.\nIt’s about people.\nIt’s about resistance, pride, unity, and courage.\n\nThe Dodgers had a chance to make history—by refusing to be part of the lie.\nInstead, they became the lie.\n\nThey didn’t just fail us. They failed everything this game is supposed to stand for.\n\nEvery bat they swing, every jersey they sell, every “Dodger Blue” banner they wave now carries the stain of this moment.\n\nSo don’t tell me to “stick to sports.”\nDon’t tell me “it’s just a tradition.”\nDon’t ask for applause when you stand shoulder to shoulder with fascism.\n\nBecause when you stand with tyranny, you stand against your fans. Against your history. Against the very spirit of this game.\n\nWe will not forget.",

        "body": "You’re missing the real story.\n\nMost of the debate around Trump’s tariffs focuses on traditional economic questions…how they’ll impact markets, consumers, or trade partners. Even this post is a distraction. But this isn’t just about economics or use of AI. It’s about restructuring how power works in America.\n\nTrump has repeatedly expressed a desire to abolish the IRS and eliminate the income tax. That would require either a repeal or rewrite of Title 26 of the U.S. Code or repeal the 16th Amendment…a nearly impossible task. But he doesn’t need to repeal it if he can defund and disable the system it created.\n\nAnd that seems to be the strategy.\n\nThe IRS is already weakened. Through appointments, budget constraints, and policy manipulation, it can be further gutted…making it harder for Congress to fund federal programs. If income tax enforcement collapses, Congress’s control over fiscal policy erodes.\n\nAt the same time, Trump is pushing tariffs…“external revenue” collected by Customs and Border Protection under DHS. While Congress officially sets tariffs, presidents now wield considerable authority under national security pretexts. If CBP becomes a revenue arm of the executive, and Congress fails to respond, this becomes a quiet shift of fiscal power to the presidency.  Just watch when Trump announces the creation of the “External Revenue Service” in the coming days. \n\nLegally, the Constitution remains. Functionally, its balance of power tilts.  A lot. \n\nWith both chambers of Congress under Republican control, opposition is unlikely. Checks and balances don’t work without political will. And this moment is revealing just how conditional that will can be.\n\nBut that still doesn’t answer the deeper question…Why is this happening now?\n\nDemographic trends show steady growth in ethnic minority populations…many of whom have historically leaned Democratic. That creates a long-term challenge for conservatives and the Republican Party, which has relied more on white, rural, and religious voters.\n\nFor some factions within that coalition…particularly Christian nationalists and others motivated by single-issue politics around abortion, gun rights, religious freedom, or LGBTQ+ issues…this demographic shift toward minorities (I.e. liberals) is seen as an existential threat. In some cases, it’s tied to openly racist/supremacist or nativist ideologies.\n\nThat’s why simultaneously immigration becomes such a hot button topic …it’s not a coincidence. Republicans understand it accelerates the demographic trend. That’s why voter suppression and gerrymandering are equally forced…they’re tools to resist that shift.\n\nAnd that’s why a strong executive isn’t feared…it’s embraced. Because in the face of a long-term political disadvantage, concentrated power becomes a survival strategy. A necessary chess move to retain influence and control. \n\nIf we keep watching only the market reaction, we’ll miss the real transformation happening right in front of us.",

    "selftext": "As reported by Axios, Trump was shaken Monday after meeting with CEO’s of top retail companies like Target. They warned him that disrupted supply chains due to his China tariffs would mean empty shelves and soaring prices very soon. You can imagine how the optics of bare shelves all around the country would look. \n\nMaybe they will get exemptions as Trump’s crony capitalism marches on but a huge number of small businesses won’t and will go under.\n\nSomewhere Xi is smirking. \n\nhttps://dailyboulder.com/shaken-trump-makes-u-turn-on-tariffs-after-being-rattled-by-dire-ceo-warning/",

        "body": "\n\nSaw this on r/Iowa\n\n\n“I’m going to get a little wonky and write about Donald Trump and negotiations. For those who don’t know, I’m an adjunct professor at Indiana University - Robert H. McKinney School of Law and I teach negotiations. Okay, here goes.\n\nTrump, as most of us know, is the credited author of “The Art of the Deal,” a book that was actually ghost written by a man named Tony Schwartz, who was given access to Trump and wrote based upon his observations. If you’ve read The Art of the Deal, or if you’ve followed Trump lately, you’ll know, even if you didn’t know the label, that he sees all dealmaking as what we call “distributive bargaining.”\n\nDistributive bargaining always has a winner and a loser. It happens when there is a fixed quantity of something and two sides are fighting over how it gets distributed. Think of it as a pie and you’re fighting over who gets how many pieces. In Trump’s world, the bargaining was for a building, or for construction work, or subcontractors. He perceives a successful bargain as one in which there is a winner and a loser, so if he pays less than the seller wants, he wins. The more he saves the more he wins.\n\nThe other type of bargaining is called integrative bargaining. In integrative bargaining the two sides don’t have a complete conflict of interest, and it is possible to reach mutually beneficial agreements. Think of it, not a single pie to be divided by two hungry people, but as a baker and a caterer negotiating over how many pies will be baked at what prices, and the nature of their ongoing relationship after this one gig is over.\n\nThe problem with Trump is that he sees only distributive bargaining in an international world that requires integrative bargaining. He can raise tariffs, but so can other countries. He can’t demand they not respond. There is no defined end to the negotiation and there is no simple winner and loser. There are always more pies to be baked. Further, negotiations aren’t binary. China’s choices aren’t (a) buy soybeans from US farmers, or (b) don’t buy soybeans. They can also (c) buy soybeans from Russia, or Argentina, or Brazil, or Canada, etc. That completely strips the distributive bargainer of his power to win or lose, to control the negotiation.\n\nOne of the risks of distributive bargaining is bad will. In a one-time distributive bargain, e.g. negotiating with the cabinet maker in your casino about whether you’re going to pay his whole bill or demand a discount, you don’t have to worry about your ongoing credibility or the next deal. If you do that to the cabinet maker, you can bet he won’t agree to do the cabinets in your next casino, and you’re going to have to find another cabinet maker.\n\nThere isn’t another Canada.\n\nSo when you approach international negotiation, in a world as complex as ours, with integrated economies and multiple buyers and sellers, you simply must approach them through integrative bargaining. If you attempt distributive bargaining, success is  impossible. And we see that already.\n\nTrump has raised tariffs on China. China responded, in addition to raising tariffs on US goods, by dropping all its soybean orders from the US and buying them from Russia. The effect is not only to cause tremendous harm to US farmers, but also to increase Russian revenue, making Russia less susceptible to sanctions and boycotts, increasing its economic and political power in the world, and reducing ours. Trump saw steel and aluminum and thought it would be an easy win, BECAUSE HE SAW ONLY STEEL AND ALUMINUM - HE SEES EVERY NEGOTIATION AS DISTRIBUTIVE. China saw it as integrative, and integrated Russia and its soybean purchase orders into a far more complex negotiation ecosystem.\n\nTrump has the same weakness politically. For every winner there must be a loser. And that’s just not how politics works, not over the long run.\n\nFor people who study negotiations, this is incredibly basic stuff, negotiations 101, definitions you learn before you even start talking about styles and tactics. And here’s another huge problem for us.\n\nTrump is utterly convinced that his experience in a closely held real estate company has prepared him to run a nation, and therefore he rejects the advice of people who spent entire careers studying the nuances of international negotiations and diplomacy. But the leaders on the other side of the table have not eschewed expertise, they have embraced it. And that means they look at Trump and, given his very limited tool chest and his blindly distributive understanding of negotiation, they know exactly what he is going to do and exactly how to respond to it.\n\nFrom a professional negotiation point of view, Trump isn’t even bringing checkers to a chess match. He’s bringing a quarter that he insists of flipping for heads or tails, while everybody else is studying the chess board to decide whether its better to open with Najdorf or Grünfeld.”\n\n— David Honig",

Companies looking to import may find they are paying higher prices before they even pay the tariffs. Canada was selling oil to America cheap because getting it anywhere else would cost a lot.

For those who say this is Chinese media, the other countries are not refuting this claim. China is taking the lead on this. For EU, I think Germany will take the lead on that.\n\nEdit 2.

The stern remarks show China intends to resist pressure to enter trade talks even as US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggests Washington could ban certain exports to China to gain leverage.\n\nWang’s call to the international community underscores China’s attempt to portray itself as the bastion of free trade as US tariffs threaten to reshape commerce globally. Beijing has repeatedly urged allies to defend multilateralism and told other governments not to cut deals with the US president at China’s expense. China has repeatedly denied being engaged in trade talks with the US. Instead, Beijing has demanded mutual respect and a cancellation of all tariffs before any negotiations.\n\nI wonder how Trump is going to respond to this. Maybe another 500% tariffs on China? Including this and GDP data this Wednesday, market is going to get rekt.

His whole pro-Trump thesis was \"he's a businessman, therefore he'll be good at the economy.\" Skip the schadenfreude, I don't wish him to be deported/scolded/redeemed by misfortune, but I find it interesting how they reached and courted this type of voter.\n\nIt seems from what I gathered it was mainly surface-level podcast type stuff. He knew NOTHING of Trump's social policies. He didn't check up. But he knew every single one of Kamala Harris' specific flaws and perceived economic problems. In his world, that's what gets maximum coverage. \n\nSo maybe reach people where they actually get their information, and be more pragmatic. I think we can say \"Fascists are bad\" 'til we're blue in the face, and many Americans will go \"so what?\" and tell you some version of the trains running on time. A more compelling message that might need to reach people with less empathy, less interest in the common good, is a simpler truth. \"Fascism promises you things it has no intention of following through on,\" and \"Fascists are historically quite incompetent, they won't fix 'the little things' you care about.\"",

Tiny margin, like 1% changing their mind would’ve upended the thing, but then the Conservatives were all “Brexit means Brexit, this was a vote to get out of everything European, including Human Rights conventions”. \n\nThing is, even a lot of people who voted for it were voting for it due to much narrower reasons. Most particularly, unhappy about topics like immigration or feeling like the world was against them because they feel poorer than they used to be (familiar yet?). It’s the thing about the democratic systems though, whatever you vote for you’ve got to be ready for the winners to take it as an overwhelming mandate for their vision and if they tell you then you shouldn’t just think they’ll become moderate when in power.\n\nSo yeah, we’re at the early stages of a downward cycle which to me began with Brexit and something new and complicated will emerge. ",

        "body": "Keep seeing people say “not if you buy American”\n\nWell here’s the thing, that’s not how markets work in real life. Doubtful that a made in America company will sell their product for less since they don’t have to pay tariffs. They are gonna look at their competitors and say look these guys raised their prices so I can get that much money for the same thing. Doubtful that he will give up profit just to undercut businesses that outsourced their labor to chi/mex/ca.\n\nEver thought about how the product are cheaper in those countries? Maybe it’s because the their countries subsidize things like healthcare and food. companies don’t have to pay higher wages because the government helps the working class.\n\n\nEdit:\nThe arguments I’ve seen in the comments show a huge misunderstanding about tariffs. Trump voters blindly defend them without fully grasping their broader economic implications. Many claim that Chinese labor is primarily forced or akin to slavery, which is an oversimplification. While labor abuses exist in some cases, the reality is far more complex. They mostly say that American-made goods will eventually become cheaper as tariffs supposedly incentivize companies to move production back to the us. This is deeply flawed logic, especially considering the temporary nature of presidency. Since we already know that Trump is only in office for 4 years, businesses have little incentive to overhaul their supply chains for what may be a short-lived policy.\n\nOthers have criticized me for allegedly portraying foreign governments as “benevolent.” That was never my argument. My point is that labor costs in countries like Mexico, Canada, and China are lower partly due to externalities, or government policies that reduce living expenses. Universal healthcare, for example, is a major cost offset. When workers don’t have to rely on employer-provided healthcare, companies can afford to pay lower wages without sacrificing quality of life. These kinds of subsidies and policies fundamentally lower the cost of production—a nuance lost in overly simplistic defenses of tariffs.\n\nMany have acknowledged the inevitable ripple effects of tariffs on the market. Even if a product is “Made in America,” its components, materials, and transportation costs are all tied to global markets, all of which will be impacted by tariffs. As a business owner, I can confirm that added costs (whether from tariffs or other factors) are almost always passed on to customers. In fact, some businesses might exploit the confusion around tariffs to justify price increases, even on products unaffected by tariffs by blaming the policy.\n\nHistorically, flat tariffs have not led to long-term economic growth in the us. some strategic tariffs after ww2 helped stabilize the global economy, these were highly targeted and part of a broader recovery plan. Flat tariffs, are blunt tools that are inherently inflationary, distort markets and ineffective. If you don’t believe me ask AI or read any credible economic analysis.",

The people that were adults then that were saying they want everything to be simple, like the good old days, but it never has been. They were just unaware, so things seemed simple. And some of them went on to raise children who raised children all the while not learning enough to realize that the \"simple\" things are the things they're uninformed about. And getting that information- like where the API for acetaminophen is made, and where it's pressed, isn't something that you're told, only because there's no regulation that demands it. Meanwhile, regulation bad! \n\nSorry for the rant. The world is getting to me lately. The idiots in the right voted, and the idiots among the left abstained. So now we get to deal with President Camacho, an idiot conspiracy theorist that wants to end contrails, and a business owner that wants to eliminate oversight and government competition against his company.",

        "body": "I think many people haven't done, not even a deep dive, but a shallow toe dipping, into economics. There are many reasons why countries export goods in abundance to other counties. We can produce things we import but maybe not as cheaply or in sufficient amount. Very simply put, let's look at coffee. Hawaii produces coffee, as do Puerto Rico, and California. They are not able to produce it in the quantities desired; consumption of coffee in the US was about 3.26 billion pounds in 2023 according to USA Facts. Hawaii is our largest domestic producer and they produced 11.5 million pounds that same year. \n\nSo... how do we satisfy the much larger demand that domestic supply? By importing. The same goes for other countries. The largest exports by the US in 2023 were mineral oils, and mineral fuels; think petroleum, refined, crude, and gas, and integrated circuits, ie. chips. \n\nThere are a number of reasons why some countries can produce certain items less expensively and in greater quantity, often relating to resources ie. mineral deposits, or growing conditions. Again let's use produce in this case bananas. Most of the US is too cold. Only the southernmost areas such as, again, Hawaii, or Florida are capable of commercial production. In 2009 the US produced 0.01% of the world production of bananas. We aren't capable of supplying our own country. Now let's look at minerals. The US does not have deposits of bismuth, graphite, gallium, and manganese to name just a few. Therefore, how can we obtain these minerals which are used in alloys, batteries, semiconductors, and LED? By importing. \n\nWe're only shooting ourselves in the foot, imo, with tariffs. Sure, we can encourage domestic production and use, but there are simply some areas in which global trade is necessary, in both directions. Others could do the same to US exports, potentially curtailing our export of certain goods. \nDo keep in mind, that goods which are not as efficiently produced here, will cost more to produce and therefore consume. So don't expect your Kona Coffee to cost the same as your Great Value coffee sourced in Colombia and Brazil. \nI won't even start with continued labor shortages and how that affects consumer costs.",

I know that many americans are friends of Canada. I'm mainly talking about MAGA and far right media figures like Tucker Carlson and Jesse Waters. In this case, I'm responding to the morons of the bourbon industry calling our trade countermeasures \"disproportionate\".\n\nBut I need to explain that America *has* not only invaded Canadian territory in the past (1812), but has also gestured at the idea of annexation at multiple other points, such as during the 1890s. Additionally, America has elected a known agent of geopolitical chaos with a popular vote majority. A president who has, in his previous term, accused us of presenting a national security issue and tried to strongarm us with tariffs. I have also heard many americans gleefully joke about Canada not being a real country, including some on the left.\n\nThere is a deeply-ingrained ideology of american exceptionalism and manifest destiny, obviously not held by all americans, but enough to have driven current and historical aggressive policies towards us.",

I guess that was enough for him to think the US is invincible and can take on the entire world all at once.\n\nIt's like if Hitler decided to invade all of Europe and Russia without any of the other Axis powers right after \"conquering\" Austria.

        "body": "This may sound crass and overly partisan but Trump is an idiot who doesn't understand basic economics. He thinks he can make a ton of money for the US from taxes while at the same time making the US a manufacturing juggernaut. He thinks every mainstream economist is wrong. The president doesn't have to go through Congress for tariffs and Trump's cabinet is made up of loyalists who will go along with whatever he says. There are no \"adults in the room.\"\n\nThis will not make Americans richer. This probably won't even help the hyper elite. The only question is if this will be \"mildly disruptive or seriously harmful.\" Trump is not pursuing a rational economic policy nor are there any guardrails against this. The only \"hope\" is that he sees the stock market plummeting while getting frantic calls from terrified CEOs and reconsiders but even then he's been a proponent of tariffs for decades. He thinks this is good policy but he's wrong.",

I typically go to the 'value' grocery chains, even where you're most likely to see people struggling on shoestring budgets. Bins for USA products are full and starting to rot, while products from Mexico, the Philippines, and others are selling fast.\n\nGrocery chains have begun to reflect the new buying habits by simply not carrying USA products since they won't sell. People who are struggling are willingly taking a financial hit as an act of patriotism for Canada.\n\nI'm also seeing a new practice become much more common, when shoppers identify an American product, they have taken to flipping the products upside down to signal to other shoppers the product is American. I actually thought this was just a social media thing until this weekend when I started witnessing it in person. Noticing this, grocery stores are starting to also update the price tags with Canadian flags to signal that it is a product of Canada.\n\nThis is going to get worse before it gets better. Based on the general unawareness of Americans cited in your post, it seems like its going to need to hurt before changes start happening.\n\nI've noticed this is often described as a response to tariffs, and for some this may be the case, but the general energy here is coming from President Trump's repeated claims of his intention to annex Canada. The unity here is wild; politically unaware people are suddenly aware and involved. I had a DnD in-person finale recently and I was in charge of our meals for 3 days. they were delighted to hear I went through the effort to exclude American products in my buying and prioritize Canada. It doesn't have to be this way, but it seems it may need to be for some time still.\n\nWe love Americans, but we'll defend ourselves as needed. #ElbowsUp",

Even if we get rid of Trump I doubt we’ll ever have our old relationship with Canada back within our lifetimes. \n\nThis is why elections and leadership matter. So many people had absolutely no idea how good we had it and thought we had nothing to lose. We had everything to lose. Those “same old” politicians people were sick of? Turns out they were doing a pretty good job. Now we’re going to find out what things are like without them. \n\nThis was a game to Americans. It’s the equivalent of when a teenager pretends to break up with their bf/gf to try to get something out of them, only to find out that the bf/gf takes the breakup a lot more seriously than they do. We insulted Canada, tried to sabotage their economy and then threatened to annex them. It turns out people take that fucking seriously. Other countries are changing their supply chains and building up their militaries for a future without partnership with the US. They’re not going to 180 on this every time we have an election. We proved not only that we’re not a reliable partner, but that we’re actually their enemy. We’re completely fucked.",

        "body": "> 1930’s tariffs\n\nThe Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 is widely regarded as a significant factor that exacerbated the Great Depression. Here's how:   \n\nReduction of International Trade:\nThe act raised tariffs on thousands of imported goods, making them significantly more expensive.   \nThis prompted retaliatory tariffs from other countries, leading to a dramatic decline in international trade.   \nThe reduction in trade meant a decrease in exports and imports, which negatively impacted businesses and economies worldwide.   \nWorsening Economic Conditions:\nThe decline in exports hurt American industries, particularly agriculture, which relied heavily on overseas markets.   \nThis led to further job losses and economic hardship.\nThe global nature of the retaliatory tariffs meant that the economic downturn was amplified across nations.   \nContributing to Global Economic Contraction:\nBy hindering international trade, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act contributed to a global economic contraction, deepening the Great Depression.   \nIt fostered a \"beggar-thy-neighbor\" policy, where countries tried to protect their own economies at the expense of others, which ultimately harmed everyone.   \nIn essence, the tariffs created a cycle of protectionism that strangled international trade, worsened economic conditions, and prolonged the Great Depression",

Hell their boy Laozi literally invented the soft touch. Plus, when your civilization is over 3000 years old, it's easier to see the bigger picture.

People rarely have one, single motivation in life, so I think it's probably a combination of all these things. He also can't ever admit he's wrong; he both wants to punish America but he also wants to be admired for making America stronger. But he's way too dumb to understand how to do that. \n\nYou guys know how he came up with this tariff idea? During his first term, he had no economic policy, so he asked Jared Kushner to think of one after giving Jared some brief ideas of what he wanted to see. Jared went on Amazon and just started scrolling through books until he found a title he really liked; \"Death by China\" by Peter Navarro. It advocated the weaponization of tariffs against everyone. Navarro is a self-described \"deficit hawk\" who spends the whole book quoting from an \"Economic expert\" named Ron Vara. It was later discovered that this expert does not exist, and is just an anagram of Navarro's last name. That didn't stop Navarro from being hired after Jared found his book. Navarro would even write memos for Trump's staff under the name of his fake source in order to give himself more credibility. This is literally the sole basis for the tariffs. Once Trump even gets a whiff of an idea he likes, he cannot let go no matter what. And he's way too stupid to understand even minor complexities. So it's a really dangerous combination of malice and ineptitude.",

Ukraine is no longer of interest to anyone, and that's good,\" Zubets commented to Gazeta.ru .\n\n\nOnly Russia, Belarus, North Korea and Cuba were exempt from US tariffs, the first three of which are involved in the war of aggression in Ukraine.\n\n\nThe United States has already imposed several sanctions on Russia, which has restricted Russian trade with the United States.\n\n\nAccording to Russian media reports , trade between the United States and Russia was $3.5 billion last year, the lowest figure since 1992.\n\n\nThe corresponding figure before Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2021 was $35 billion.\n\n\nOleg Savchenko , deputy chairman of the State Duma's Financial Markets Committee and Duma representative, is gloating over the tariffs imposed by Trump.\n\n\nHe said Russia knows what awaits countries that are subject to tariffs.\n\n\n\"Russia has experienced all these difficulties because of sanctions. We are ready for any challenges, so we can sit with popcorn and watch how this ends,\" Savchenko told Gazeta.ru.\n\n\nHowever, Savchenko does not believe that the Russian economy will benefit in any way from avoiding tariffs.\n\n\nRussian experts have different views on whether the Russian economy benefits from avoiding customs duties or not.\n\n\nRussia, isolated by various sanctions, is not completely disconnected from the global economy, so Trump's tariffs will ultimately affect it as well.\n\n\nInvestment analyst Aleksandr Razuyev considers Russia's exclusion from tariffs above all as a sign of friendship.\n\n\n“It is kind to both our country and personally to President Vladimir Putin .”\n\n\nHe has written a comment on the impact of Trump's tariffs on Russia on the Finam.ru market website.\n\n\nRazujev writes that customs duties raise the prices of all goods in the world, which also makes illegal imports to Russia more expensive.\n\n\nHe believes that Trump's tariffs will also have a negative impact on the Russian economy, even though it avoided tariffs, unlike 185 other countries.\n\n\nRazuyev predicts that the trade war will lead to a global recession and lower oil prices, which will be detrimental to the Russian economy.\n\n\nHowever, he looks ahead.\n\n\n“We are living in very interesting times. I believe that our country will play all its trump cards and become a great superpower. And Trump will help with that, but it will not happen until all the dead and wounded as a result of his policies are removed.”\n\n\nEconomist Mikhail Belyaev, in turn, estimated for the Regnum news website that US tariffs are forcing European countries to turn towards Russia.\n\n\nThe Chinese market is so competitive that, according to Belyaev, Europeans will not survive unless they reorient their trade to the East.",

Such investigations would typically fall under the purview of powerful congressional panels like the Senate Judiciary Committee or the Senate Finance Committee. Both are chaired by Republicans—Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho—who have largely avoided conflict with the White House. Individual lawmakers like Schiff can investigate matters using personal office staff, though such investigations would lack subpoena power.\n\n>Still, the timing of Trump’s announcement—and the market rally that followed—has raised eyebrows on Capitol Hill. “When my own barber asks me whether Donald Trump is selling short or doing this to try to make money for himself, it shows that a lot of people are pretty suspicious about what’s going on,” Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, tells TIME.",

But I very often find out that smart college graduates from families that value education don't understand the history and importance of the US dollar as the global reserve currency. Separate from accounting and finance, why is this not a critical component of US history curriculum?\n\nThe pithiest modern explanation I have for why people should know this is that it totally answers and rebukes Trump's obsession with trade deficits. It doesn't matter that the US buys more from China than China buys from the US, because nearly every transaction China has with any other country happens using US dollars. Not directly of course, but the net effect is that *our* financial intuitions and *our* banks get a cut of *every* multinational transaction out there. This more than offsets whatever trade deficit might exist, and it ensures that *your* bank accounts and *your* retirement savings are the best they can be. Globally, we have the cheapest borrowing costs and the highest interest earnings on deposits (once you adjust for currency). The value of this to us cannot be understated, and Trump is on a direct path to fuck it all up.\n\nI really urge everyone that will listen to least read the Wikipedia article on the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944. People need to understand how fucking lucky we were to win that negotiation, and how there is no way in hell we would win a similar negotiation today. If we lose today what we got back then, there is probably no chance of ever getting it back.",

I have other friends who also have young kids and they also work overtime so by the time they get home and tucked the kids into bed, they're more likely to turn on a K-drama on TV rather than the news.\n\nWhen I ask them about firing federal workers or gutting to civil rights, they go, \"huh?\" But ask them about the tariffs and inflation and watch 'em go.
