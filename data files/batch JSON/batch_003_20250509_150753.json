        "body": "If anybody is wondering why Trump would engage in such absurd \"negotiation\" tactics, it can be traced to his history and pathology.  Here's a professor whose specialty is negotiations discussing in-a-nutshell why Trump's tactics are incredibly foolish:\n\n----\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to get a little wonky and write about Donald Trump and negotiations. For those who don't know, I'm an adjunct professor at Indiana University - Robert H. McKinney School of Law and I teach negotiations. Okay, here goes.\n\nTrump, as most of us know, is the credited author of \"The Art of the Deal,\" a book that was actually ghost written by a man named Tony Schwartz, who was given access to Trump and wrote based upon his observations. If you've read The Art of the Deal, or if you've followed Trump lately, you'll know, even if you didn't know the label, that he sees all dealmaking as what we call \"distributive bargaining.\"\n\nDistributive bargaining always has a winner and a loser. It happens when there is a fixed quantity of something and two sides are fighting over how it gets distributed. Think of it as a pie and you're fighting over who gets how many pieces. In Trump's world, the bargaining was for a building, or for construction work, or subcontractors. He perceives a successful bargain as one in which there is a winner and a loser, so if he pays less than the seller wants, he wins. The more he saves the more he wins.\n\nThe other type of bargaining is called integrative bargaining. In integrative bargaining the two sides don't have a complete conflict of interest, and it is possible to reach mutually beneficial agreements. Think of it, not a single pie to be divided by two hungry people, but as a baker and a caterer negotiating over how many pies will be baked at what prices, and the nature of their ongoing relationship after this one gig is over.\n\nThe problem with Trump is that he sees only distributive bargaining in an international world that requires integrative bargaining. He can raise tariffs, but so can other countries. He can't demand they not respond. There is no defined end to the negotiation and there is no simple winner and loser. There are always more pies to be baked. Further, negotiations aren't binary. China's choices aren't (a) buy soybeans from US farmers, or (b) don't buy soybeans. They can also (c) buy soybeans from Russia, or Argentina, or Brazil, or Canada, etc. That completely strips the distributive bargainer of his power to win or lose, to control the negotiation.\n\nOne of the risks of distributive bargaining is bad will. In a one-time distributive bargain, e.g. negotiating with the cabinet maker in your casino about whether you're going to pay his whole bill or demand a discount, you don't have to worry about your ongoing credibility or the next deal. If you do that to the cabinet maker, you can bet he won't agree to do the cabinets in your next casino, and you're going to have to find another cabinet maker.\n\nThere isn't another Canada.\n\nSo when you approach international negotiation, in a world as complex as ours, with integrated economies and multiple buyers and sellers, you simply must approach them through integrative bargaining. If you attempt distributive bargaining, success is impossible. And we see that already.\n\nTrump has raised tariffs on China. China responded, in addition to raising tariffs on US goods, by dropping all its soybean orders from the US and buying them from Russia. The effect is not only to cause tremendous harm to US farmers, but also to increase Russian revenue, making Russia less susceptible to sanctions and boycotts, increasing its economic and political power in the world, and reducing ours. Trump saw steel and aluminum and thought it would be an easy win, BECAUSE HE SAW ONLY STEEL AND ALUMINUM - HE SEES EVERY NEGOTIATION AS DISTRIBUTIVE. China saw it as integrative, and integrated Russia and its soybean purchase orders into a far more complex negotiation ecosystem.\n\nTrump has the same weakness politically. For every winner there must be a loser. And that's just not how politics works, not over the long run.\n\nFor people who study negotiations, this is incredibly basic stuff, negotiations 101, definitions you learn before you even start talking about styles and tactics. And here's another huge problem for us.\n\nTrump is utterly convinced that his experience in a closely held real estate company has prepared him to run a nation, and therefore he rejects the advice of people who spent entire careers studying the nuances of international negotiations and diplomacy. But the leaders on the other side of the table have not eschewed expertise, they have embraced it. And that means they look at Trump and, given his very limited tool chest and his blindly distributive understanding of negotiation, they know exactly what he is going to do and exactly how to respond to it.\n\nFrom a professional negotiation point of view, Trump isn't even bringing checkers to a chess match. He's bringing a quarter that he insists of flipping for heads or tails, while everybody else is studying the chess board to decide whether its better to open with Najdorf or Gr√ºnfeld.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî David Honig, Robert H.

Because heavy crude oil is harder to refine so it sells for less but yields more fuel. So US oil companies sell almost all oil they harvest.

And that you deserve to be punished for it.\n\n¬†Now there are sides. So since the other side is wrong, then your side must be right. So since your side is right then it can't be wrong, becuase that would mean that you were wrong. So when your sides leaders say things you like and agree with, well that's just great! Why would they lie about that? If they say things you don't like, well they didn't mean that, or they were just kidding or being sarcastic, or it was taken out of context. Or maybe they never heard it at all because their side never tells them about it.¬†\n\nBut then they say it again and again, and it goes from not actually a thing to its not that big of a deal, to well now they actually did the thing so it's fine, and since the other side said it was wrong then my side must be right by doing it.

It's not even a Trump era thing, he's just another symptom after we kept thinking all of the other symptoms would eventually go away. But all of these problems have been chipping away at our collective¬†morality.\n\nWe've spent so much time slowly creeping away from being able to talk to our neighbors and engaging in our communities that we've become more isolated than ever, but we are social creatures so we crave that sense of belonging, so a lot of folks find it in the very things that aim to divide us.¬†\n\nIt's weaponized tribalism.",

You can‚Äôt just spin up an entire resources/electronics manufacturing industry in a year or two. \n\nIt would take decades and let‚Äôs not forget the reason these industries left the US in the first place: it‚Äôs cheaper to outsource it to China. The American consumer demanded a cheaper product, the US corporations wanted to cut costs, so manufacturing was outsourced. \n\nSo it doesn‚Äôt mean that consumers switch to American-made alternatives (as they don‚Äôt exist), and end up paying more for the same products.\n\nHe didn‚Äôt bring back America‚Äôs steel industry during his last term as president, and won‚Äôt if he wins again in November. \n\nHe wants to offset this with lowering taxes, but the chances are the cost to consumer increase from tariffs will outweigh his alleged tax cuts. He‚Äôs more likely to give tax cuts to corporations and high earners than everyday Americans anyway, one again screwing over the people who vote for him.",

All this is going to do is make other countries make it harder for us to get critical minerals, which will kill our steel industry. \n\nTrump is completely wrecking the country from the ground up. Unrecoverable. All for a quick buck for his puppet-masters.\n\nEditing to add because some people seem confused:\n\nHere's what I do for work. I design vehicles that use various types of metals, plastics and tech. Part of designing is knowing the materials - composition, availability, import/export, etc. \n\nWe import 97% of the manganese ore we use. About 70% of that goes straight to our steel industry. While we can produce tiny amounts of manganese in the US, it's not economically viable and cannot compete with Gabon or South Africa's production. So if Trump breaks trade relations with those countries or their allies, we could suddenly find our entire steel industry shut down. We are the THIRD largest steel producer in the world. Our economy depends on our steel industry. \n\nBut that's not even the tip of what Trump is doing. Because there are dozens of other critical minerals and materials that we rely on importing to keep various industries afloat. You know China provides almost 100% of our gallium? That's where we get it all to keep our electronic, solar panel and electric car industries supplied. If we get cut off, there goes all those industries. \n\nCanada provides 80% of our potash through imports. No potash means no farming. \n\nWant a fun google trip? Google **\"critical minerals in the US\"** and see where we import these necessary things from. Canada is on there. China. Australia. All the countries Trump is using violent measures instead of diplomacy with. And more. \n\nScary stuff. Truly.",

Okay, here goes.\n\nTrump, as most of us know, is the credited author of ‚ÄúThe Art of the Deal,‚Äù a book that was actually ghost written by a man named Tony Schwartz, who was given access to Trump and wrote based upon his observations. If you‚Äôve read The Art of the Deal, or if you‚Äôve followed Trump lately, you‚Äôll know, even if you didn‚Äôt know the label, that he sees all dealmaking as what we call ‚Äúdistributive bargaining.‚Äù\n\nDistributive bargaining always has a winner and a loser. It happens when there is a fixed quantity of something and two sides are fighting over how it gets distributed. Think of it as a pie and you‚Äôre fighting over who gets how many pieces. In Trump‚Äôs world, the bargaining was for a building, or for the construction work, or subcontractors. He perceives a successful bargain as one in which there is a winner and a loser, so if he pays less than the seller wants, he wins. The more he saves the more he wins.\n\nThe other type of bargaining is called integrative bargaining. In integrative bargaining the two sides don‚Äôt have a complete conflict of interest, and it is possible to reach mutually beneficial agreements. Think of it, not a single pie to be divided by two hungry people, but as a baker and a caterer negotiating over how many pies will be baked at what prices, and the nature of their ongoing relationship after this one gig is over.\n\nThe problem with Trump is that he sees only distributive bargaining in an international world that requires integrative bargaining. He can raise tariffs, but so can other countries. He can‚Äôt demand they not respond. There is no defined end to the negotiation and there is no simple winner and loser. There are always more pies to be baked. Further, negotiations aren‚Äôt binary. China‚Äôs choices aren‚Äôt (a) buy soybeans from US farmers, or (b) don‚Äôt buy soybeans. They can also (c) buy soybeans from Russia, or Argentina, or Brazil, or Canada, etc. That completely strips the distributive bargainer of his power to win or lose, to control the negotiation.\n\nOne of the risks of distributive bargaining is bad will. In a one-time distributive bargain, e.g. negotiating with the cabinet maker in your casino about whether you‚Äôre going to pay his whole bill or demand a discount, you don‚Äôt have to worry about your ongoing credibility or the next deal. If you do that to the cabinet maker, you can bet he won‚Äôt agree to do the cabinets in your next casino, and you‚Äôre going to have to find another cabinet maker.\n\nThere isn‚Äôt another Canada.\n\nSo when you approach international negotiation, in a world as complex as ours, with integrated economies and multiple buyers and sellers, you simply must approach them through integrative bargaining. If you attempt distributive bargaining, success is impossible. And we see that already.\n\nTrump has raised tariffs on China. China responded, in addition to raising tariffs on US goods, by dropping all its soybean orders from the US and buying them from Russia. The effect is not only to cause tremendous harm to US farmers, but also to increase Russian revenue, making Russia less susceptible to sanctions and boycotts, increasing its economic and political power in the world, and reducing ours. Trump saw steel and aluminum and thought it would be an easy win, BECAUSE HE SAW ONLY STEEL AND ALUMINUM - HE SEES EVERY NEGOTIATION AS DISTRIBUTIVE. China saw it as integrative, and integrated Russia and its soybean purchase orders into a far more complex negotiation ecosystem.\n\nTrump has the same weakness politically. For every winner there must be a loser. And that‚Äôs just not how politics works, not over the long run.\n\nFor people who study negotiations, this is incredibly basic stuff, negotiations 101, definitions you learn before you even start talking about styles and tactics. And here‚Äôs another huge problem for us.\n\nTrump is utterly convinced that his experience in a closely held real estate company has prepared him to run a nation, and therefore he rejects the advice of people who spent entire careers studying the nuances of international negotiations and diplomacy. But the leaders on the other side of the table have not eschewed expertise, they have embraced it. And that means they look at Trump and, given his very limited tool chest and his blindly distributive understanding of negotiation, they know exactly what he is going to do and exactly how to respond to it.\n\nFrom a professional negotiation point of view, Trump isn‚Äôt even bringing checkers to a chess match. He‚Äôs bringing a quarter that he insists on flipping for heads or tails, while everybody else is studying the chess board to decide whether its better to open with Najdorf or Gr√ºnfeld.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî David Honig\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the award!

Trump and his club of insider billionaires has zero fear of consequences related to sketchy trading activity. He'll probably pardon the whole lot at the end of his stint anyway while they laugh all the way to the bank. This is why insiders prostrate themselves before trump, they want access to the spoils.\n\nThis is a \"plan\" alright, just not the plan they keep carping on TV about.",

        "body": "To be fair, Trump *is* good at talking out both sides of his ass. There are a variety of classic Trump Moves that accomplish it.\n\n1. **The Backwalk** ‚Äî Go to maximum in the beginning of the sentence, then step it back. E.g.\n\n>*These Mexicans are Rapists and Murderers and some of them, I suppose, are good people*\n\n2. **The Statistics Escalator** ‚Äî Always offer 3 numbers, getting increasingly crazy, and attribute the last one to nobody. E.g.\n\n>*Under Biden the real unemployment rate is 8, 10, some even say as high as 15 percent*  \n\n3. **Schr√∂dinger's Subjunctive** ‚Äî say you never said something but imply you might have, deny again, but imply you agree. E.g.\n\n>*I never said that, I never said that, but even if I had, it would have been true. I never said that. I would have meant it. But I never said it*\n\nSo, let's combine these 3 moves into a powerful Trump combo about trade. Remember, he never said this, but if he did, it would sound a lot like this, and it would be exactly the type of thing he would say. But he never said it:\n\n>America is getting ripped off. For too long, ripped off. And we're not going to get ripped off anymore. Our enemies rip us off, but our friends rip us off even worse. So we're going to have Tariffs. Tariffs. I love that word. Tariffs. We'll have big, beautiful tariffs. And we want trade, we want good trade with our friends, we want the best trade and the most trade, but we've gotta have tariffs too, we can't keep getting ripped off. But we'll have the best trade. And we'll have tariffs. We'll have rates at 10, 20 maybe even as high as 100%. And we're gonna shut down unfair goods from being dumped on our markets. And I never said prices would go up, I never said that, but if I would say that, I think it would be a very temporary thing and soon we'll find ourselves wealthier than ever before, but I'd never say that. I'd never say that. If I did it would be temporary. Temporary. But I'd never say that.\n\nAnd there you have it. You can read whatever you want into that. You can take it the Ackman way or the Harris way or both or something in between. Because this is how Trump talks.",

Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA), and Chris Coons (D-DE) have already proposed the [STABLE Act](https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-and-coons-introduce-legislation-to-require-congressional-approval-of-new-tariffs-on-us-allies-ahead-of-expected-trump-tariffs) which would require congress to approve any tariffs on American allies.\n\nHere's my optimistic prediction:\n\n1. Canada's retaliatory tariffs are specifically targeting red states. They will hurt, and people will start pressuring their representatives.\n\n2. Republicans realize that their base is struggling, and fighting back against Trump is an easy win.\n\n3. All Democrats and some Republicans vote to limit the president's tariff powers.\n\nThe Republicans have a razer thin majority in congress. Sanctions are spectacularly unpopular even among Trump's base. We're not just stuck with 4 years of unchecked power.",

President Trump‚Äôs recent tariffs are a spectacularly poor policy choice that increases costs for American consumers and businesses. This legislation would give congress the authority to reverse the tariffs and fight any future attempts to impose them on our allies.\n\nTariffs have been considered a bad idea by almost every serious economist in the last fifty years. They were partially responsible for causing the Great Depression. Even Trump's closest advisors were opposed to the idea. Congress needs a way to fight against this nonsense.\n\nTrade policies should serve the best interests of the American people and maintain strong international partnerships, not burden them with unnecessary economic hardship. The STABLE Trade Policy Act would ensure that trade policy respects the needs of the country instead of the whims of one man. I urge you to support this legislation and advocate for its swift passage to protect American households from further price hikes.\n\nSincerely,[Your Name][Your City, State]",

        "body": "I got this from TikTok,\n\nI am writing to you as a deeply concerned constituent to urge you to take immediate action to hold President Donald Trump accountable for his recent actions, which I believe constitute a gross abuse of executive power, a threat to national security, and a direct assault on the constitutional foundations of our nation. Specifically, I request that you support and advocate for the introduction of articles of impeachment against President Trump for his overreach of Congress‚Äôs power of the purse, his unconstitutional attempts to undermine the 14th Amendment, his dangerous executive orders, and his deplorable handling of critical issues that endanger the safety, security, and wellbeing of the American people.\nOver the past two weeks, President Trump has repeatedly crossed the line of executive authority, demonstrating a blatant disregard for the rule of law, the separation of povers, and basic human decency. His attempt to freeze federal funding for essential programs, even after a federal judge blocked his order, is a direct assault on Congress‚Äôs constitutional power of the purse. This action not only undermines the legislative branch‚Äôs authority but also jeopardizes the well-being of millions of Americans who rely on these programs for their livelihoods. His proposed funding cuts to education, healthcare, and other vital services pose a significant risk to our nation‚Äôs future, threatening to weaken our economy and leave countless individuals without access to critical resources.\nFurthermore, President Trump‚Äôs efforts to undermine the 14th Amendment and block birthright citizenship are deeply alarming. The 14th Amendment is a cornerstone of our Constitution, guaranteeing equal protection under the law and affirming the principle of birthright citizenship. By attempting to overturn this fundamental right through executive order, President Trump is not only acting unconstitutionally but also eroding the very principles that define our nation as a land of opportunity and equality. Equally troubling are his threats to deport the native stewards of our land, including Indigencis peoples and long-standing residents who have contributed to the fabric of our society. His administration‚Äôs plans to establish concentration camps for migrants at Guantanamo Bay are a horrifying escalation of his inhumane immigration policies.\nSuch actions are not only morally reprehensible but also a violation of international human rights standards and the values we hold dear as a nation.\nPresident Trump‚Äôs response to the recent plane crash, which he directly caused by firing key personnel and using Elon Musk to pressure others qualified key players to step down, was nothing short of deplorable. His reckless actions endangered the lives of innocent civilians and military personnel, and his subsequent attempts to deflect blame and downplay the tragedy demonstrate a shocking lack of leadership and empathy. This incident underscores the dangers of his impulsive decision-making and the urgent need to hold him accountable for his actions.\nAdditionally, President Trump‚Äôs appointment of unqualified nominees to critical positions in government poses a grave risk to o9r r.atonal security and public safety. These individuals lack the expertise and judgment necessary to protect our nation from threats, both foreign and domestic.\nTheir presence in key roles undermines the integrity of our institutions and puts the lives of Americans at risk.\nPresident Trump‚Äôs recent executive orders and actions represent a dangerous escalation of executive overreach. They threaten the checks and balances that are essential to our democracy and set a dangerous precedent for future administrations. If left unchecked, these actions could irreparably harm the integrity of our constitutional system, the rights of all Americans, and the stability of our nation.\nI urge you to take a stand against these abuses of power by supporting the introduction of articles of impeachment against President Trump. It is your duty as a member of Congress to uphold the Constitution, protect the rights of your constituents, and ensure the safety and security of our nation. The American people deserve leaders who will defend our democracy and hoid these epower accountable for their actions.\nThank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I trust that you will act in the best interests of our nation and its people. I look forward to your response and hope to see your leadership in addressing these critical issues.\n\nSincerely,",

He was always quick to castigate Biden and Kamala for the tiniest of perceived faults but would have every excuse in the book for Trump's and his lackey's blatantly bad behavior.  But now, as a small business owner who sources a lot from China, he's now feeling the pinch of the tariffs.  I can tell he's worried.  Plus it's been very satisfying to me watching him realize that every single thing I told him would happen is actually now happening.  Now I don't say a word but I definitely don't feel sorry for him.  He voted for this.  Now he can suffer from his poor choices.",

Smart phones have destroyed attention spans. Sex education is under attack and has been for at least 40 years. COVID has fucked with a lot of people's cognitive abilities, I count myself in this group. For some reason after all of that I just listed, the Paul brothers, Andrew Tate, and similar, rotted the nation along with many others behind a subscribed stream.

    "selftext": "Republicans keep acting like this is just a culture war, as if it's about DEI, immigrants, or whatever grievance of the week gets them riled up. But what they‚Äôre enabling under Trump isn‚Äôt a debate. It‚Äôs a global threat, and the rest of the world sees it clearly.\n\nTrump has insulted allies, threatened to abandon NATO, and pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord again. He has imposed tariffs on Canada and Germany out of spite, joked about annexing Canada, and treated diplomacy like a reality show. These are not policies. They are provocations, and they are shaking the global order.\n\nNow he has pulled back support for Ukraine, unraveling years of unity and leaving Europe to question whether the U.S. can still be trusted.\n\nRepublicans have already made clear they don't care how this affects people here. But they seem equally indifferent to the fact that it's dragging the rest of the world down with them. Their loyalty to Trump is wrecking alliances, stalling climate action, emboldening dictators, and unraveling decades of shared progress.\n\nTo much of the world, it looks like insanity - a country sabotaging the very systems it built, while millions cheer it on like a sport. This isn‚Äôt just short-sighted. It's a betrayal of everything we once stood for, both at home and abroad. The world is not confused. They're disgusted. And they‚Äôre right to be.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI just realized every so-called right-wing reply in this sub comes from a negative karma troll account. Seriously check accounts - negative 60, negative 100, every time. Are you guys bots, trolls, or just Republicans who can‚Äôt post from a real profile? You need a burner just to spread MAGA filth? This is crazy. ",

He isn't what most would call a \"bad guy\". Not by a long shot. \n\nAnd yet he fell into right wing politics. When I was younger, it was just as sort of a mild curiosity. But when he got divorced from my mom, he started to indulge that side more and more. He became \"religious\". He started talking about Obama, and how he was letting \"Sharia law\" take over. \n\nHe isn't a Trump supporter. Didn't support him in the 2015 primaries, and he has recently called Trump \"a huge mistake\". But that only means he voted for the libertarian candidate. \n\nHe won't support Trump, but at the same time it is impossible to have a conversation with him about what's going on in politics because he refuses to acknowlege that what Trump is doing is *terrible*. He acts like he's merely a \"lame\" president, rather than an obvious overreaching authoriatrian. \n\nThe other day on the phone I was trying to rationalize with him. I was trying to share my apprehension about the coming economic situation. I am in my mid 30s. I am not rich, and my familiy recently had a financial set back. We are still \"OK\", but a really bad six months could wreck us. Our dream of a home, of a future better than our present, won't happen. \n\nMy dad, who is retired on a military pension, got a good chunk of money from his father passing that he invested and made money on, responded to my fears by saying, \"well, I'll be OK if things go bad. I bought a lot of gold.\" \n\nAnd it really just hit me. Like, this is what he's become. His son is sharing genuine fears about what the person in power is going to do, and his first reaction is about how *he* will be OK, because he has a little pile of gold he thinks will keep him safe.\n\nMy father wouldn't say he's MAGA. But MAGA is a small part of the overall problem in the states. Most people are more like my father than anything. They're scared, small people who had big ideals when they were young, and let them get battered down by the corrupt world that they allowed to spring up around them. They capitulated to almighty capital, and so long as *they* feel secure, they are incapable of truly seeing or helping anyone else. \n\nIt's really, really sad. I hate that he's like this. I hate that he cannot, or will not, see what he's become, or what is becoming of the world around him. His fear, and pride, and stubbornness all keep him trapped in this deeply unwell bubble of denial.",

Following the Second World War, the United States crafted the post-war international order, rebuilding its enemies and providing defense, trade policy and the world's reserve currency until the election of Donald Trump, who alienated all of the country's allies, caused an economic depression, and attempted to abolish the nation's Constitution and establish a repressive, authoritarian dictatorship, causing the country to collapse and states to secede, bringing the nation to an end.\n\nShorter answer: A failed experiment.",

He accused the administration of using ChatGPT to calculate the tariffs the U.S. is charged by other countries, \"which is why the tariffs make absolutely no fucking sense.\"\n\n\"They're simply dividing the trade deficit we have with a country with our imports from that country, or using 10%, whichever is greater,\" Destiny, who goes by @TheOmniLiberal on X, shared in a post on Wednesday.\n\nHe attached a screenshot of his exchange with the AI bot. He started by asking ChatGPT, \"What would be an easy way to calculate the tariffs that should be imposed on other countries so that the US is on even-playing fields when it comes to trade deficit? Set minimum at 10%.\"\n\n\"To calculate tariffs that help level the playing field in terms of trade deficits (with a minimum tariff of 10%), you can use a proportional tariff formula based on the trade deficit with each country. The idea is to impose higher tariffs on countries with which the U.S. has larger trade deficits, thus incentivizing more balanced trade,\" the bot responded, along with a formula to use.",

Prior to that you had people like Eisenhower who said things like:\n\n\"If a political party does not have its foundation in the determination to advance a cause that is right and that is moral, then it is not a political party; it is merely a conspiracy to seize power.\"\n\n\"Teachers need our active support and encouragement. They are doing one of the most necessary and exacting jobs in the land. They are developing our most precious national resource: our children, our future citizens.\"\n\nand \"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at all in any true sense. Under the clouds of war, it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron.\"\n\nThe Nation tried to hold its Chief Executive (Nixon) accountable and instead it all got washed away. This was a signal that accountability is now optional. So begin a line that runs through -> Reagan -> Limbaugh -> Gingrich -> O'Reilly and Fox as a Whole -> Bush Jr. and Co. -> McConnell -> Trump.\n\nWithin that line you have a lot of supporting cast of varying degrees and success: Stone, Koch Bros, Ailes, Turning Point, Alex Jones, Musk, and a whole lot more working in front of and behind the camera.\n\nWe also can't forget about the Heritage Foundation and a good chunk of the Judiciary now.\n\n\"Mark my word, if and when these preachers get control of the [Republican] party, and they're sure trying to do so, it's going to be a terrible damn problem. Frankly, these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they can't and won't compromise. I know, I've tried to deal with them.\" - Barry Goldwater\n\nWe've yet to truly (or even mostly) grab accountability back from the watergate era. A good portion of that has been non-stop blasting from the right messaging to divide and conquer. Two main messages: 1) 'They' are coming to harm you. - We know the 'In' group is White, Wealthy, Native-Born, Heterosexual, Christian, Cis-Gendered, Male. So the 'out' group is deviants from it - If you're a black queer woman? Oh boy. 2) Muddy the waters. Gaslight Obstruct Project.\n\nbefore the election I was cautiously optimistic we were going to finally hold true the notion 'no one is above the law.'  However, now that it seems clear trump will likely die without ever facing real consequences for his actions the best we can do for now is damage control and hope we will choose to be less apathetic in the future.",

For instance, if they want to invest a certain percentage of every paycheck in the market, sure - just tell us how much up front, and do it at pre-scheduled times.\n\nI cannot imagine there are any credible arguments against this type of modest solution to combat blatant insider trading. It wouldn't even prevent them from investing - just from using their insider knowledge to invest.",

It's not JUST gaming equipment either, it's all electronics that use chipsets made in China. \n\nUnless you're a Gen Z'er making over $138,000 a year, you're losing money on tax credits, voting for Trump (compared to Harris). Where's that money going you asked? It's going to the earners who make MORE that $138k a year. Under Trump: $6,255 in tax credits to people making $217k a year, $22,000 to those making $590k a year, and a whopping $377,000 credit to those making over $14m a year. Conversely under Kamala, she gives no tax credit increase to those making over $591k a year, and INCREASES taxes on all the tax brackets after that, finishing with a tax INCREASE of $167,000 on earners making over $14million a year. \n\nLet me ask you this Gen Z? Why should you get less tax credits while the top 0.1% of earners get $377,000 a year in additional tax credits? Do you really think that rich MF'er needs that money more than your broke ass needs a boost in your tax refund? It may only be $400-$500 exta under Harris, but thats 1-2 months of groceries. That's 1-2 car payments. Were any of you that voted for Trump paying attention? Why were you so willing to take Trump at his word that he'd lower income tax too? He laid out ZERO plans to accomplish it. He just said he would and you all went \"I guess he will then\". Unbelievable.",

The problem is, many Chinese made products are not made by the US at all, so new companies will have to be created, or existing companies will have to begin designing and manufacturing them.  \nIt is possible, but would take a few years at least.\n\nIn the 1980s/1990s, Japanese car makers built car plants in the US to get around high import tariffs, so Trump's tariffs could work, but we will have to wait and see.",
