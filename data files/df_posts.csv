**Amazon to display tariff costs for consumers**

Amazon doesn’t want to shoulder the blame for the cost of President Donald Trump’s trade war.

So the e-commerce giant will soon show how much Trump’s tariffs are adding to the price of each product, according to a person familiar with the plan.

The shopping site will display how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs – right next to the product’s total listed price.

1ifwraa,all,tariff,Friendly reminder that congress can revoke Trump's ability to impose tariffs,"Congress has the authority to impose tariffs according to the commerce clause of the constitution, but they delegated that responsibility to the president after 9/11.

They can pass a bill to claw that power back. Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA), and Chris Coons (D-DE) have already proposed the [STABLE Act](https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-and-coons-introduce-legislation-to-require-congressional-approval-of-new-tariffs-on-us-allies-ahead-of-expected-trump-tariffs) which would require congress to approve any tariffs on American allies.

Here's my optimistic prediction:

1. Canada's retaliatory tariffs are specifically targeting red states. They will hurt, and people will start pressuring their representatives.

2. Republicans realize that their base is struggling, and fighting back against Trump is an easy win.

3. All Democrats and some Republicans vote to limit the president's tariff powers.

The Republicans have a razer thin majority in congress. Sanctions are spectacularly unpopular even among Trump's base.

Whilst all this is happening, you know what has Trump been up to you? 

He has been planning for a very special dinner instead of addressing this very crucial situation that affects all of us. 

[Trump headlining $1 million a person super PAC dinner as stocks sink over tariffs](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-hosts-liv-golf-fundraiser-as-stocks-sink-over-tariffs/)

I kinda find it very foul that this administration is doing nothing about this current issue on the hand and is allowing all this Chaos to take place in the market. 

They have done nothing to ease the current situation and if this continues and if truly have black Monday awaiting tomorrow, it would be catastrophic economic crisis caused by the administration and would cause numerous businesses to go bankrupt and spark mass unemployment as a consequence. 

Very sad to see this whole situation unfold like this.

Alright you beautiful degenerates, listen the fuck up. This isn’t just another $GME circlejerk or YOLO on $SPY puts. We are standing on the edge of a historic, systemic financial collapse—and the match has already been lit.

TL;DR: The Fed blinked. Treasuries are teetering. China holds the detonator. You have days—maybe weeks—before the floor vanishes.

https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/minn-feds-kashkari-rising-treasury-yields-could-show-investors-moving-us-2025-04-11/

Let’s lay it out:

Trump jacked tariffs on China to kingdom come. China hit back at 125%. But here’s the trick: they STOPPED there. No more escalation. That wasn’t weakness. That was positioning. 

Japan, China, and South Korea—yeah, the countries that usually hate each other—started chatting like old war buddies. Why? Because Trump’s trade policy has turned the U.S. into a geopolitical liability. They’re not teaming up for fun—they’re hedging against the collapse of American sanity.

Then Japan started dumping U.S. Treasuries. Quietly. Just enough to send yields vertical and make Wall Street sweat bullets. That wasn’t random—it was a signal.

South Korea? Still pumping chips. TSMC might start whispering to the Taiwanese government that maybe, just maybe, aligning with China isn’t such a bad idea if it means Trump stops threatening their supply chain. Yeah—soft reunification pressure, served cold.

China’s sitting on $759B in U.S. bonds. They start selling slowly. Not fast enough to crash the market—but enough to make everyone else wonder who’s selling. Then the dominoes fall. BRICS nations? Gone. Gulf states? Gone. Eurozone? GONE.

And what do we get today? The Fed blinks.
“We’ll stabilize the market if needed.”
Translation: “Please don’t run. But we’re scared shtless and ready to turn the money printers back on.”

That’s it. That’s the whole ballgame.
They just confirmed the Treasury market can’t stand without life support.

You are going to see:

Yields go to the fucking moon

Dollar starts shivering

Foreign investors pulling out

Bond auctions flopping like a meme ICO

Credit lines dying overnight

Illiquid companies—boom, dead

Fed intervention—guaranteed

And maybe, just maybe, a global fucking run on the U.S. debt system

This isn’t a recession. This is the moment the U.S. stops being the center of global finance.

Get your puts. Get your gold. Hell, get your memes. But know this:

China’s not starting a war. They’re ending one.
And they’re doing it with the one thing we can’t print: trust.

Tick tock.

I hope to fuck I'm just an idiot.

Update:

https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCBP/bulletins/3db9e55

Wrong. I got pulled into a call this morning by HR with my boss. They did the whole schtick of ""we value for your time and effort and loyalty blah blah blah but with the Trump election and incoming tariffs and uncertainty in the economic future we have to downsize and thus we are ending your employment effective immediately blah blah blah""

The worst part? I had been working closely with my boss for the past few months towards earning a promotion. I wanted to earn it and my boss and I had made a roadmap of tasks and  new duties so I could EARN a promotion by the end of the year. I was well on track and not just surviving but thriving!

1jtsgph,all,tariff,The Dodgers Didn’t Just Visit the White House—They Stood with Fascism,"The Los Angeles Dodgers—Jackie Robinson’s team, the team of Ebbets Field, of resistance, of breaking barriers—just stepped into the White House and gave legitimacy to a man unraveling American democracy before our eyes.

They stood and smiled next to a president who jails his critics. Who has weaponized the justice system against political enemies. Who uses tariffs not to protect workers but to punish dissent. Who spreads hate, fear, and lies like wildfire.

This isn’t tradition.
This isn’t “just a team visit.”
This is normalization.
This is appeasement.

And if you love baseball, you should be furious.

Because baseball has always been more than a game. It’s been a mirror of who we are. It broke the color line before the country did. It stood tall through world wars, recessions, and reckonings. And now? The Dodgers—one of the most iconic franchises in the sport—just handed their legacy to an authoritarian regime for a photo op.

Let’s talk about history.

In 1936, American athletes went to Berlin and saluted Hitler. They said it was about sport. They said it was apolitical.
In 1973, Chile’s elites posed with Pinochet as his military rounded up and tortured dissidents.
In 1940s Italy, celebrities played along while Mussolini crushed civil rights and censored truth.

They all told themselves they were “just following tradition.”
They all believed they were above the politics of their time.
And every one of them was swallowed by the moment they refused to confront.

That’s what the Dodgers just did.

This wasn’t silence. It was a statement:
That this regime is acceptable.
That there’s no line too far.
That money, comfort, and access matter more than truth, justice, and democracy.

And for any baseball fan who still believes in the soul of this game? You should feel betrayed.

Because baseball isn’t about power.
It’s about people.
It’s about resistance, pride, unity, and courage.

The Dodgers had a chance to make history—by refusing to be part of the lie.
Instead, they became the lie.

They didn’t just fail us. They failed everything this game is supposed to stand for.

Every bat they swing, every jersey they sell, every “Dodger Blue” banner they wave now carries the stain of this moment.

So don’t tell me to “stick to sports.”
Don’t tell me “it’s just a tradition.”
Don’t ask for applause when you stand shoulder to shoulder with fascism.

Because when you stand with tyranny, you stand against your fans. Against your history. Against the very spirit of this game.

Prime Minister Mark Carney vowed to retaliate against Trump’s proposed tariffs with countermeasures that would hit the U.S. hard. He also criticized America’s lax gun laws and weak border control, blaming them for illegal firearms entering Canada. Carney condemned major U.S. online platforms, calling them breeding grounds for hate and extremism.

This isn’t a dip. It’s not a correction. It’s the slow, brutal unraveling of a debt-soaked fantasy we’ve been pretending was sustainable since 2008. The Fed is cornered—rates are high, inflation refuses to die, and there's no bailout coming this time. The only soft landing is for the billionaires with parachutes made of your 401(k).

Tech is imploding under the weight of hype and weak fundamentals. AI was a sugar high. Now we’re crashing. Banks are getting shaky. Commercial real estate is a time bomb. And consumers? They're maxed out, broke, and paying 29% on credit cards to buy gas and eggs.

And just when we needed stability, we get chaos: Trump’s back in the mix with unhinged tariffs, trade wars 2.0, and economic policies that look like they were scribbled on a napkin in a Denny’s at 3 a.m. Markets hate uncertainty—guess what? That’s all we’ve got now.

This isn’t a crash. It’s controlled demolition with nobody at the controls.

Sell, don’t look back, and maybe plant a garden. We had a good run.

Goodbye, and may whatever comes next be merciful.

1jvf45s,all,tariff,"Trump folded, it was because of the bond market","""People were getting a little queasy."" Trump says he was watching bond market reaction to tariff measures

 President Donald Trump said he was watching volatility in the bond market in recent days and appeared to indicate that it was among the factors that led to his decision to institute a 90-day pause on some tariffs.

“I was watching the bond market. The bond market is very tricky. I was watching it. But if you look at it now, it’s beautiful. The bond market right now is beautiful. But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy,” he said.

CNN reported prior to the president’s decision that US Treasury yields had risen in recent days as investors sold off bonds. The benchmark 10-year yield Wednesday morning was 4.4% – up from 3.9% before Trump unveiled his tariffs.

Trump also said he watched JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Fox Business Network this morning.

The CEO “made the statement to the effect that something had to be done with the tariffs and trade. … He understood it,” Trump said. “It wasn’t sustainable what was happening. Somebody had to pull the trigger. I was willing to pull the trigger.”

During that appearance, Dimon warned that a recession was a “likely outcome” of the escalating trade war resulting from Trump’s tariff policies.

“No one’s wishing for (a recession) but hopefully if there is one it’ll be short,” he said. “I do think fixing these tariff issues and trade issues would be a good thing to do.”

Fox News, along with their usual breaking news chyron, also had the Dow index displayed while Trump was speaking, showing a fall of more than 650 points.

>“Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States. Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!” Trump posted.

BEIJING, March 31 (Reuters) - China, Japan and South Korea agreed to jointly respond to U.S. tariffs, a social media account affiliated with Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said on Monday.The comments came after the three countries held their first [economic dialogue](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-china-japan-agree-promote-regional-trade-trump-tariffs-loom-2025-03-30/) in five years on Sunday, seeking to facilitate regional trade as the Asian export powers brace against U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Edit. For those who say this is Chinese media, the other countries are not refuting this claim. China is taking the lead on this. For EU, I think Germany will take the lead on that.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said appeasement will only embolden the “bully” at a BRICS meeting, rallying the group of emerging-market nations to fight back against US levies.

China’s top diplomat warned countries against caving into US tariff threats, as the Trump administration hints at the possible use of new trade tools to pressure Beijing.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said appeasement will only embolden the “bully” at a BRICS meeting, rallying the group of emerging-market nations to fight back against US levies. The stern remarks show China intends to resist pressure to enter trade talks even as US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggests Washington could ban certain exports to China to gain leverage.

Wang’s call to the international community underscores China’s attempt to portray itself as the bastion of free trade as US tariffs threaten to reshape commerce globally. Beijing has repeatedly urged allies to defend multilateralism and told other governments not to cut deals with the US president at China’s expense. China has repeatedly denied being engaged in trade talks with the US. Instead, Beijing has demanded mutual respect and a cancellation of all tariffs before any negotiations.

I wonder how Trump is going to respond to this. Maybe another 500% tariffs on China? Including this and GDP data this Wednesday, market is going to get rekt. Get your lubes ready.

You cannot openly support Trump while he's a direct threat of our Nation and economy. 

This is coming from someone that was going to vote PP, but now will wait for his actions, not his words.. We need to unite, as a country, first and foremost. Left/Liberals vs Right/Conservative is irrelevant right now.

We cannot back down from the tariffs, until Orange man does first. That's all there is to it. We need to put tariffs, that will affect key swing states like; Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, etc(nothing against you guys!). So then, the support from MAGA supporters in those states, start crashing out.

Citing “senior Wall Street execs with ties to the White House,” Gasparino wrote on X that people within Trump’s administration have held private discussions with business leaders about an “agreement in principle with India.” He further reported that the deal could be used as a template for other trade deals the administration is working on with Japan and other countries. Markets have taken sharp hits amid uncertainty surrounding Trump’s tariffs and trade deals.

But what they’re enabling under Trump isn’t a debate. It’s a global threat, and the rest of the world sees it clearly.

Trump has insulted allies, threatened to abandon NATO, and pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord again. He has imposed tariffs on Canada and Germany out of spite, joked about annexing Canada, and treated diplomacy like a reality show. These are not policies. They are provocations, and they are shaking the global order.

Now he has pulled back support for Ukraine, unraveling years of unity and leaving Europe to question whether the U.S. can still be trusted.

Republicans have already made clear they don't care how this affects people here. But they seem equally indifferent to the fact that it's dragging the rest of the world down with them. Their loyalty to Trump is wrecking alliances, stalling climate action, emboldening dictators, and unraveling decades of shared progress.

To much of the world, it looks like insanity - a country sabotaging the very systems it built, while millions cheer it on like a sport. This isn’t just short-sighted. It's a betrayal of everything we once stood for, both at home and abroad. The world is not confused. They're disgusted. And they’re right to be.

1jdoxuy,all,tariff,I just lost my job because of Donald Fucking Trump,"Not even a fucking year ago I moved to this city specifically for this job. It was as close to a dream job as I could ask for: it was a small company (less than 10 employees), non-corporate, it shared the same values I did, and all of of my coworkers were just beyond fantastic, I genuinely couldn’t have asked for much better. I literally never once was written up, in fact my employer had nothing to say except to sing my praises when I would ask for feedback! I did damn good work, and I was proud to work there. 

Welp, it was all for fucking nothing. 

Since the election, and since the inauguration especially, we have been a lot more open in the office about talking our political beliefs, and exactly none of us were happy with Trump being elected, let alone the daily bombardment of downright crazy shit he’s been doing since 1/20. 

Come today, the owner asked me to come in a little early. We had a new employee starting in my department so I just assumed it was related to that, and discussing how the power structure or division of work would happen once they start. Could not have been further from the truth. 

He starts with asking me about my weekend and how I’m feeling (I called out sick Friday) and after some small talk he goes “listen ____, I’ve loved having you work here and you’ve been so stellar in the role and frankly I’ve been so impressed with your work since you started here.  But unfortunately since the election, our business has taken a massive hit financially. Tariffs are screwing us, the markets are crashing, and frankly people aren’t buying our goods like they used to. So we need to reshuffle the company structure a bit, so today will be your last day.”


I took this job specifically because it was a place I saw myself long term, it was a place I could be content staying at for more than a few years. I went $20k in debt moving halfway across the fucking country and for this job, just for me to lose it because Donald Fucking Trump has to go and play god emperor with our country. And my now ex-boss did say he would help me find a new job however he could, but like I work in a small niche industry, the odds of finding another job in my city is small to none…
